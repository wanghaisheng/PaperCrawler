Methods The prospective cohort study of term infants with perinatal asphyxia treated at Helsinki University Hospital's neonatal units in 2016-2020 used Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (HNNE) and brain MRI at 2 weeks and Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) and GM assessment at 3 months of age. Results Analysis included 50 infants: 33 displaying perinatal asphyxia without hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE), seven with HIE1 and 10 with HIE2. Of the infants with atypical HNNE findings, 24/25 perinatal asphyxia without HIE cases, 5/6 HIE1 cases and all 10 HIE2 cases showed atypical findings in the HINE. The HINE identified atypical spontaneous movements significantly more often in infants with white matter T2 hyperintensity. Conclusion In this cohort, most infants with perinatal asphyxia, with or without HIE, presented atypical neurological findings in sequential examinations. The profile of neurological findings for children with perinatal asphyxia without HIE resembled that of children with HIE. White matter T2 hyperintensity was associated with atypical spontaneous movements in the HINE and was a frequent MRI finding also in perinatal asphyxia without HIE.",,,,,"Toiviainen-Salo, Sanna/HGB-7213-2022; Haataja, Leena/G-1160-2016; Haataja, Leena/GPG-3986-2022","Toiviainen-Salo, Sanna/0000-0003-1176-8165; Haataja, Leena/0000-0002-8057-6194; Vanhatalo, Sampsa/0000-0002-9771-7061; Tuiskula, Anna/0000-0003-3900-6429",,,,,,,,,,,,,0803-5253,1651-2227,,,,FEB,2022,111.0,2,,,,,291,299,,10.1111/apa.16133,0,,NOV 2021,,,,,,34599610.0000,,,,,WOS:000719468000001,0.0

The test is recommended at corrected term age in preterm; and around 2 weeks postnatal age in term neonates. As the current trend is to discharge based on physiological stability, it may not be feasible to perform HNNE at recommended age. The authors investigated whether predictive ability of the test for neurodevelopmental disability remained unchanged if performed early (before discharge). Methods: The authors enrolled preterm and at-risk term neonates. HNNE PE was performed before discharge in all infants. The test was repeated in preterm infants at 40 weeks postmenstrual age and in term neonates at 2 weeks of age (HNNE RA). Neurodevelopmental disability was assessed at 1 year of age. Results: HNNE PE was done in 125 neonates (103 preterm, 22 term neonates). HNNE RA was done in 58% infants. Neurodevelopmental disability was assessed in 84 (67%) of infants. Neurodevelopmental disability was noted in 14/84 (16.6%) babies. The receiver operating characteristic curve of raw scores showed that area under the curve for HNNE PE (0.71) and HNNE RA (0.66) were similar. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for both the tests were similar for a cutoff optimality score of 32.5. HNNE PE could be performed up to 4 weeks earlier than HNNE RA with the same predictive ability for neurodevelopmental disability. Conclusions: HNNE PE was as reliable as HNNE RA in predicting neurodevelopmental disability at 1 year of age. Completion of the test is assured and provides several weeks lead time for early intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0883-0738,1708-8283,,,,OCT,2020,35.0,11,,,,,731,736,8.83074E+14,10.1177/0883073820930487,0,,JUN 2020,,,,,,32516057.0000,,,,,WOS:000541342300001,0.0

Aim: To assess the utility of neonatal screening assessments-writhing general movements (GMs) and the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (HNNE)-to predict CP/high-risk status at 3-4 months' CA in extremely preterm infants. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of high-risk preterm infants (born < 29 weeks' gestation and/or birth weight < 1000 g) attending an Early Neurodevelopment Clinic. Data from neonatal assessments were compared with CP/high-risk diagnosis at 3-4 months' CA, fidgety GMs, and Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examinations (HINE) using logistic regression, linear regression, and Spearman rank correlation. Results: Two hundred and two preterm infants (median gestation age at birth 27.3 (IQR 25.4-28.3) weeks, mean birth weight 870.3 (SD 248.4) grams) were included. A total of 26 (12.8%) infants received early CP/high-risk diagnoses at 3-4 months' CA. A lower gestational age (GA) (OR = 0.78; p = 0.029, 95% CI [0.26, 0.97]) and abnormal writhing GMs (OR 1.56; p = 0.019, 95% CI [1.07, 2.27]) were predictive of CP/high-risk diagnosis. Although after adjustment for sex, GA, birth weight, and growth restriction, GA (aOR = 0.67; p = 0.068, 95% CI [0.44, 1.03]) and writhing GMs (aOR = 1.44; p = 0.087, 95% CI [0.95, 2.20]) were not significant, a strong trend still persisted. The HNNE scores significantly correlated with both the HINE evaluation (r(s) = 0.43, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.31, 0.56]) and fidgety GMs (r(s) = -0.10, p = 0.012, 95% CI [ -0.32, -0.04]). Linear regression confirmed the HNNE was highly predictive of the HINE (correlation coefficient 0.82; p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.48, 1.15]). Writhing GMs did not significantly correlate with either fidgety GMs (p = 0.723, 95% CI [ -0.12, 0.17]) or the HINE (p = 0.173, 95% CI [-0.24, 0.04]). Conclusions: Abnormal writhing GMs in the neonatal period were non-significantly associated with early CP/high-risk diagnoses in extremely preterm infants in a multivariate analysis.

The primary aim of our study was to characterise and contrast the neurodevelopmental profile of well LPI with full-term infants (FTI) (39(+0)-41(+6) weeks) using the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (HNNE). Our secondary aim was to obtain local reference ranges for the 34 items in the HNNE in an Asian-dominant population. Methods LPI were assessed at two time points: 12-72 h of life and at TCA of 39(+0)-41(+6) weeks, while FTI were assessed at 12-72 h of life using the HNNE. Each of the 34 items on the HNNE was assigned an optimality score (OS) of 0, 0.5 or 1, totalling up to 34. A quantitative comparison of the neurobehavioral patterns was made using two-sample t-tests. Results A total of 212 infants (79 LPI and 133 FTI) were recruited. Mean OSs for LPI and FTI at birth were (25.11 +/- 3.36)/34 and (31.19 +/- 1.50)/34, respectively, with a mean difference of 6.08 (P value <0.0001). The mean OS for LPI on reaching TCA was (28.91 +/- 2.30)/34, with a mean difference of 2.28 (P value <0.0001). Reference OSs for the 34 items on the HNNE were also obtained.

MethodThis was a diagnostic study using data from a prospective birth cohort. A total of 104 infants born preterm at less than 31 weeks gestational age (males n = 61; mean = 28 weeks 1 day [SD 1 week 6 days], range 23 weeks 1 day-30 weeks 6 days) underwent HNNE early and at TEA, which were scored by comparison with term data. Motor outcomes at 12 months corrected age were determined using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (scores <= 85). Cut-off points were determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. ResultsSixteen (15%) infants born preterm had motor impairment at 12 months corrected age. The HNNE total score cut-off points with the best combination of sensitivity and specificity at early and TEA assessments were 15.2 or lower (sensitivity 77%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 46%-95%; specificity 74%, 95% CI = 63%-83%) and 23.5 or lower (sensitivity 67%, 95% CI = 38%-88%; specificity 66%, 95% CI = 54%-76%) respectively.

InterpretationThe HNNE provides moderate predictive accuracy for motor outcome at 12 months corrected age in infants born very preterm.

Of particular interest was to compare these findings with the original British study that validated the HNNE, and published data from other low- and middle-income countries. Study design: In a nested substudy of a larger prospective study (IMPRINT: Impact of Malaria in Pregnancy on Infant Neurodevelopment), 140 low-risk, term-born neonates (39.3 +/- 1.4 weeks gestation) at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana were administered the 34-item HNNE from birth to 48 h of age by trained physicians. Neonates' performance was compared with previously published normative data from the United Kingdom (1998), and published data from Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Uganda. Results: Ghanaian neonates demonstrated lower scores on 29/34 HNNE items relative to normative data from the United Kingdom (P < .05), with only 5% of Ghanaian neonates in our sample classified as neurologically optimal. There were significant differences in the proportion of neonates scoring optimally per HNNE item between our Ghanaian sample, compared with published data from other settings (Thai [13/16 items], Burmese [14/16 items], Vietnamese [7/9 items], and Ugandan [22/34 items] neonates). Raw scores were markedly different between Ghanaian and British neonates, with Ghanaian neonates demonstrating lower median and wider range of scores. These differences were less prominent between Ghanaian and Ugandan neonates. Conclusion: Our findings raise questions as to whether or not the thresholds for optimality for the HNNE based on data from the United Kingdom are applicable to Ghanaian newborns. Our study could not fully resolve whether the differences in scores were due to genetic differences in developmental pathways, the implementation of the assessment, or the characteristics of our sample. Low proportions of neonates scoring optimally from other low- and middle-income countries suggest the need for further research to determine the clinical utility of the HNNE in resource-limited settings, including the predictive value for neurodevelopment later in infancy.

We hypothesized that use of an asymmetry score, in addition to the assessment's standard total cutoff score, could remedy this problem in a clinical setting. METHODS: This retrospective study of a neonatal intensive care follow-up program with consistent clinical use of the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination matched infants with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy to infants without motor delays or evidence of neurodevelopmental impairments. Groups had same corrected and gestational ages at Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination assessment. Asymmetry presence was recorded. RESULTS: Of 74 infants with cerebral palsy, 28 had quadriplegia, 11 had diplegia, and 35 had hemiplegia. Median total Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination and asymmetry scores for hemiplegia were 57.5 and 10 versus 76 and 0 for those without cerebral palsy. Sensitivity and specificity to distinguish hemiplegia from typical development by combining a total Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination score less than 63 and an asymmetry score greater than 5 were 91.8% and 100%, respectively.

The etiology of motor impairments in preterm infants is multifactorial and incompletely understood. Whether corpus callosum development is related to impaired motor function is unclear. Potential associations between motor-related measures and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the corpus callosum in preterm infants were explored. Methods. Eight very preterm infants (gestational age of 28-32 weeks) underwent the Hammersmith neonatal neurological examination and DTI assessments at gestational age of 42 weeks. The total Hammersmith score and a motor-specific score (sum of Hammersmith motor subcategories) were calculated. Six corpus callosum regions of interest were defined on the mid-sagittal DTI slice-genu, rostral body, anterior midbody, posterior midbody, isthmus, and splenium.. e fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of these regions were computed, and correlations between these and Hammersmith measures were sought. Results. Anterior midbody FA measures correlated positively with total Hammersmith (rho = 0.929, p = 0.001) and motor-specific scores (rho = 0.857, p = 0.007). Total Hammersmith scores also negatively correlated with anterior midbody MD measures (rho = -0.714, p = 0.047). Discussion. These results suggest the integrity of corpus callosum axons, particularly anterior midbody axons, is important in mediating neurological functions. Greater callosal maturation was associated with greater motor function. Corpus callosum DTI may prove to be a valuable screening or prognostic marker.",,,,,"Rose, Stephen/C-8044-2009; Finnigan, Simon/F-8034-2010; Pannek, Kerstin/C-8059-2011; Guzzetta, Andrea/F-1503-2010; D'Acunto, Giulia/K-2484-2018; Colditz, Paul B/F-6772-2010","Finnigan, Simon/0000-0003-1291-0741; Pannek, Kerstin/0000-0002-6512-7630; Guzzetta, Andrea/0000-0003-3868-0059; D'Acunto, Giulia/0000-0002-1464-9113; Colditz, Paul B/0000-0002-6408-8238; Snow, Pamela/0000-0002-2426-8349; Rose, Stephen/0000-0003-1558-6297",,,,,,,,,,,,,2090-5904,1687-5443,,,,,2013,2013.0,,,,,,,,359532,10.1155/2013/359532,0,,,,,,,,23509639.0000,,,,,WOS:000314540800001,0.0

Methods Early-preterm infants were assessed neurologically at term-corrected age using the Hammersmith neonatal neurological examination. The raw scores of the 34 Hammersmith neonatal neurological examination items were converted to optimality scores. Pairwise comparison of neurobehavioural patterns between early-preterm infants at term-corrected age versus late-preterm and full-term infants at similar gestational ages were made using independent sample t tests. Differences in optimality scores between the three groups were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance. Results Sixty-eight early-preterm infants assessed at term-corrected age were compared against 75 late-preterm infants and 133 full-term infants. Mean total optimality scores (+/- standard deviation) of early-preterm, late-preterm and full-term infants at term-corrected age were 27.68 (+/- 3.97), 29.09 (+/- 2.45) and 31.58 (+/- 1.39), respectively (P < 0.001). The mean optimality score of early-preterm infants was significantly lower when compared pairwise with late-preterm infants and full-term infants with mean difference of -1.42 (P = 0.013) and -3.91 (P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion The neurobehavioural profile of early-preterm infants lags significantly behind those of late-preterm and full-term infants at term-corrected age.

Phenobarbital (PB) has been traditionally used as the first-line treatment for neonatal seizures. More recently, levetiracetam (LEV) has been increasingly used as a promising newer antiepileptic medication for treatment of seizures in neonates. Objectives. The aim of our study was to compare the effect of PB vs. LEV on short-term neurodevelopmental outcome in infants treated for neonatal seizures. Method. This randomized, one-blind prospective study was conducted on term neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of S. Bambino Hospital, University Hospital Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele, Catania, Italy, from February 2016 to February 2018. Thirty term neonates with seizures were randomized to receive PB or LEV; the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (HNNE) was used at baseline (T0) and again one month after the initial treatment (T1). Results. We found a significantly positive HNNE score for the developmental outcomes, specifically tone and posture, in neonates treated with LEV. There was no significant improvement in the HNNE score at T1 in the neonates treated with PB. Conclusion. This study suggests a positive effect of levetiracetam on tone and posture in term newborns treated for neonatal seizures. If future randomized-controlled studies also show better efficacy of LEV in the treatment of neonatal seizures, LEV might potentially be considered as the first-line anticonvulsant in this age group.",,,,,"Pisani, Francesco/K-3486-2018; Pavone, Piero/H-5097-2019; Ruggieri, Martino Michele Lucio Giovanni/A-3055-2014","Pavone, Piero/0000-0002-5600-9560; CORSELLO, Giovanni/0000-0002-0218-8110; Vitaliti, Giovanna/0000-0003-4181-6287; Falsaperla, Raffaele/0000-0002-4482-3506",,,,,,,,,,,,,0953-4180,1875-8584,,,,,2019,2019.0,,,,,,,,3683548,10.1155/2019/3683548,0,,,,,,,,31281546.0000,,,,,WOS:000471878100001,0.0

Study design: This is a nested substudy of a larger prospective study (IMPRINT: Impact of Malaria in Pregnancy on Infant Neurodevelopment) comprising 140 low-risk, term-born neonates at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana, between November 2018 and February 2019. The sample was stratified into three gestational age groups: early-term (37 + 0-38 + 6, weeks + days; n = 61), full-term (39 + 0-40 + 6, weeks + days; n = 52), and late/post-term (41 + 0-42 + 6, weeks + days; n = 27). Neonates were administered the 34-item HNNE by trained physicians. As per the original British scoring system, raw scores for the Ghanaian sample were plotted and scores 10th centile were assigned a score of 1, 5th-10th centile 0.5, and < 5th centile 0. Results: The range of raw scores for 16/34 HNNE items varied with gestational age. Specifically, 100% (7/7), 50% (5/10), 33% (1/3), 20% (1/5), and 14% (1/7) of items within the orientation and behavior, tone, abnormal signs/patterns, movements, tone patterns, and reflexes subdomain, respectively showed a different distribution of scores above the 10th centile across the three gestational age groups. Conclusion: Differences in gestational age-specific results within our sample in comparison to the original British sample could be, albeit unlikely, due to misclassification of gestational age, unmeasured maternal or fetal morbidity, or perhaps more likely, variation in testing or test conditions, or some combination of these. Genetic variation in neurological development is also a possibility. Further research is warranted to determine the reasons for differences.

Study design: Prospective cohort study to examine the expected range of values for MPT (born 32(+0) to 33(+6)), LPT (344(-0) to 36(+6)) and FT (born 37 to 42 weeks' gestation) infants' performance on the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (HNNE), the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioural Scale (NNNS) and Prechtl's General Movements Assessment (GMA) in the first weeks after birth. Further, to determine the effects of sex, gestational age at birth, and postmenstrual age at assessment on the 3 different assessments within the gestational age groups. Subjects: 80 MPT, 129 LPT and 201 FT infants were recruited shortly after birth from a tertiary hospital. Results: The means, standard deviations and 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th and 95th centiles are presented for the HNNE and NNNS for each of the three gestational age groups. Overall, FT infants performed better than MPT and LPT infants. The rate of normal GMA within the first few weeks after birth was 25% for MPT, 32% for LPT, and 90% for FT infants. The effects of sex, and postmenstrual age at assessment varied between test and gestational age groups. Conclusions: This study provides normative data for the HNNE, NNNS, and GMA administered within the first weeks after birth in a sample of MPT, LPT and healthy FT infants.

Materials and methods: In our single-centre longitudinal cohort study, of the 73 consecutive infants admitted to our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), 49 infants (80%) received both Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) at 3- and 6-months corrected age and Bayley-III neurodevelopmental assessment at 2-3 years chronological age. At 3 months follow up, 8.2% had suboptimal scores (below 10th percentile) on the HINE. At 6 months follow up, 4.1% had suboptimal scores (below 10th percentile) on the HINE. The means(+/- SD) for Bayley-III cognitive, language, and motor subscales were (96.3 +/- 9.8), (99.9 +/- 11.9), (93.2 +/- 9.9). Results: At 3 months corrected age, higher total HINE scores and subscores for function of cranial nerves, posture, tone, were associated with better cognitive scores while poorer scores for function of cranial nerves, movements, and total HINE score were associated with lower motor scores. Infants with a HINE subscore of function of cranial nerves in the suboptimal range have three times higher odds of having a motor delay. Infants with a HINE subscore of function of cranial nerves in the suboptimal range have more than two times higher odds of having a language delay. At 6 months corrected age, poorer scores for function of cranial nerves, reflexes, and total HINE score were associated with worse Bayley-III motor scores whilst infants who have a total HINE score and a subscore of reflexes in the suboptimal range have four and seven times, respectively, higher odds of having a motor delay.

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Level IV neonatal intensive care unit and outpatient primary care centre. Participants Infants with NOWS receiving pharmacological treatment and unexposed controls matched for gestational age at birth and post-menstrual age at MRI. Main outcomes CBF assessed by ASL on non-sedated 3-Tesla MRI and standardised Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (HNNE) within 14 days of birth. Results Thirty infants with NOWS and 31 control infants were enrolled and included in the final analysis. Global CBF across the brain was higher in the NOWS group compared with controls (14.2 mL/100 g/min +/- 5.5 vs 10.7 mL/100 g/min +/- 4.3, mean +/- SD, Cohen's d=0.72). HNNE total optimality score was lower in the NOWS group compared with controls (25.9 +/- 3.6 vs 28.4 +/- 2.4, Cohen's d=0.81). A penalised logistic regression model including both CBF and HNNE items discriminated best between the two groups. Conclusions Increased cerebral perfusion and neurological examination abnormalities characterise infants with NOWS compared with those without intrauterine drug exposure and suggest prenatal substance exposure affects fetal brain development. Identifying neurological and neuroimaging characteristics of infants with NOWS can contribute to understanding mechanisms underlying later outcomes and to designing potential new treatments. This prospective cohort study found that 30 infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome had higher global cerebral blood flow and more neurological exam abnormalities than 31 unexposed controls.

Aim: We aimed to explore relationships between early postnatal cranial ultrasonography (cUS) linear measures of brain size and brain growth with neurobehaviour at TEA in infants born <30 weeks' gestational age (GA). Study design: Prospective observational cohort study. Subjects: 137 infants born <30 weeks' GA without major brain injury on neonatal cUS. Outcome measures: Neurobehaviour at TEA assessed using the General Movements Assessment (GMA) and Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (HNNE). Results: The GMA was administered in 115/137 (84%) infants; 80 (70%) presented with abnormal general movements (GMs) (79 poor repertoire, 1 cramped synchronised). The HNNE was assessed in 106/137 (77%) infants; 52 (49%) had a suboptimal total score. With respect to brain size, larger measures of the corpus callosum length (CCL) and right anterior horn width (AHW) at 1-month were related to lower risk of abnormal GMs, and larger measures of the biparietal diameter at 1-week and 2-months were related to lower risk of a suboptimal HNNE. As for brain growth, increases of the CCL and transcerebellar diameter between birth and 1-month, and left and right AHWs between 1-and 2-months, were related to lower risk of abnormal GMs. Conclusion: Early postnatal brain size and brain growth were related to neurobehaviour at TEA in infants born <30 weeks' GA.

Method A total of 257 infants (91 very preterm, 166 moderate-late preterm; 120 males, 137 females) had structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurological and behavioural assessments (Prechtl's general movements assessment, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale [NNNS] and Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination [HNNE]). Two hundred and sixty-three infants (90 very preterm, 173 moderate-late preterm; 131 males, 132 females) had diffusion MRI and assessments. Associations were investigated between assessment scores and global brain volumes using linear regressions, regional brain volumes using Voxel-Based Morphometry, and white matter microstructure using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. Results Suboptimal scores on some assessments were associated with lower fractional anisotropy and/or higher axial, radial, and mean diffusivities in some tracts: NNNS attention and reflexes, and HNNE total score and tone, were associated with the corpus callosum and optic radiation; NNNS quality of movement with the corona radiata; HNNE abnormal signs with several major tracts. Brain structure-function associations generally did not differ between the very and moderate-late preterm groups.

Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the predictive power of neuroimaging, GMA and HINE for neurodevelopmental delay and cerebral palsy (CP) in infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) who were treated with hypothermia. Study design: Retrospective cohort. Subjects and outcome measures: This retrospective study included 47 (18 female and 29 male) infants who were treated with hypothermia due to HIE. Neonates with a diagnosis of HIE were followed and assessed using neuroimaging, GMA, HINE and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-II (Bayley II) between 3 m and 2 years of age. Results: Out of the 47 infants with HIE, no fidgety movements were observed in 5 infants. The sensitivity and specificity in determining the psychomotor developmental index (PDI) score were 97% and 100%, respectively, for MRI; 92.9% and 100% for GMA; and 91.9% and 80% for the HINE. The sensitivity and specificity in determining the mental developmental index (MDI) score were 95% and 85.7%, for MRI; 90.5% and 80% for GMA; and 91.9% and 50% for HINE. The sensitivity and specificity in determining CP diagnosis at the age of 2 years were 83.3% and 95%, for MRI; 83.3% and 100% for GMA; and 83.3% and 87.8% for HINE. Conclusion: The interpretation of MRI, and HINE that are performed within the early period of life may be the gold standard for the early detection of neurodevelopmental risks in 2-year-old infants with HIE.

Preterm infants have higher rates of cognitive and behavioral difficulties at school age than their term-born peers. We hypothesized that neurobehavior at term would be different in very preterm infants compared with term infants and that perinatal exposures would be associated with these alterations in neurobehavior. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Two standardized neurobehavioral evaluations were completed on 207 infants at term equivalent, including 168 very preterm infants (< 1250 g or < 30 weeks' gestation) and 39 term control infants. The assessments used were the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale and the revised Hammersmith Neonatal Neurologic Examination. The relationship of perinatal variables to preterm infant neurobehavioral scores for both evaluations was examined. RESULTS. Compared with term-born infants, preterm infant neurobehavior was significantly altered for the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurologic Examination total score and all of the subtotals. Similarly, preterm infants displayed altered neurobehavior for the majority of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale summary scores. Complete perinatal data were available for 157 of 168 very preterm infants. The perinatal variables most strongly associated with altered preterm infant neurobehavior on multivariate regression analysis included the total number of days of assisted ventilation, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Positive perinatal influences on neurobehavioral performance at term on multivariate analysis included maternal antenatal steroids, female gender, and infants receiving breast milk at discharge home. CONCLUSIONS. Preterm infants at term equivalent showed alterations in motor behavior and higher cortically integrated functions. The pattern of abnormality in neurobehavior differed in relation to perinatal exposures.

Method We conducted a retrospective study of infants born at term at risk of neurodevelopmental impairments assessed using the HINE between 3 and 12 months post-term age and compared them with a cohort of typically developing infants born at term. All infants performed a neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years of age using the Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition; the presence of cerebral palsy (CP) was also reported. The infants were classified as being cognitively normal/mildly delayed or significantly delayed (MDI < 70).

Perinatal conditions, such as extreme prematurity, perinatal asphyxia, and their complications can lead to lifelong sensorimotor, cognitive and behavioral impairment. Prediction of long-term neurodevelopment of preterm and ill term infants at risk for brain injury at an early stage remains a big challenge. Identification of brain lesions and disturbed function is essential for an accurate diagnosis. Currently, the prediction of the outcome is based on a variety of diagnostic tools and clinical assessment of developmental milestones. Several methods for early diagnosis and neuromonitoring of brain injury are available, such as cerebral ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age as well as neuromonitoring tools, such as amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and/or conventional EEG and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), general movements assessment (GMA) and clinical assessment by, e.g., the Hammersmith neonatal/infant neurological examination (HNNE/HINE), all of which require substantial personnel and also technical resources. As better biomarkers are urgently needed scientific investigations currently focus on identification of innovative biomarker patterns (omics) and (epi)genetic markers. Furthermore, the individual child's development is determined not only by clinical risk factors, such as associated diseases but also by the socioeconomic environment. Estimation of the most accurate and early prognosis is cost-intensive, but crucial to adequately guide patients and counsel families. The initiation of early interventions is important as the plasticity of the developing brain is highest around birth and in the first few months of life. This review focuses on the characterization of the abovementioned diagnostic tools and the possibilities for combination for outcome prognosis. In addition, an outlook is given on how new technologies can facilitate the prediction of development and follow-up care of these children following perinatal brain injury.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0026-9298,1433-0474,,,,AUG,2022,170.0,8,,,SI,,688,703,,10.1007/s00112-022-01542-4,0,,JUL 2022,,,,,,35909417.0000,,,,,WOS:000819685100004,0.0

METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study of infants born preterm who had repeated HINEs between 3 and 12 months corrected age. At 2 years, cognition was assessed using the Mental Development Index (MDI; from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition) and the presence and severity of CP was determined. All children were classified as cognitively typical/mildly delayed or significantly delayed (MDI <70) and CP. The predictive validity of HINE scores for significantly delayed cognitive performance, in children with and without CP, was calculated using specific cut-off scores according to age at assessment. RESULTS: Of 1229 eligible infants (gestational age 25-36wks, mean [SD] 34.9 [2.3]; 646 males, 583 females), 1108 did not develop CP, 891 had an MDI that was typical/mildly delayed, and 217 had an MDI less than 70. Of the 121 infants who developed CP, the MDI was typical in 28, mildly delayed in 27, and less than 70 in 66.

Aims: The purpose of this retrospective study was firstly, to evaluate the neuromotor development of infants with cerebral palsy (CP) by the HINE, during the first year of age; secondly, to correlate the scoring of this neurological tool with levels of the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Methods: A cohort of 70 infants with a diagnosis of CP at 2 years of age was evaluated by the HINE at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of corrected age and by GMFCS at 2 years of age. Results: The main results indicate that at 3-6 months, infants with quadriplegia (IV and V levels of GMFCS) and those with severe diplegia (III level) scored below 40, whereas those with mild or moderate diplegia (I-II level) and hemiplegia (I-II level) mainly scored between 40-60. Interestingly, the 26% of infants with herniplegia scored >= 67 at 12 months. We observed a strong (r = -0.82) and significant (p < 0.0001) negative correlation between the scores of the neurological examination and the levels of GMFCS. Conclusions: Our results point out that the HINE can give additional information about neuromotor development of infants with CP from 3-6 months of age, strictly related to the gross motor functional abilities at 2 years of age.

Computer vision-based systems have successfully replaced various manual medical processes such as analyzing physical and biomechanical parameters, physical examination of patients. These systems are gaining popularity because of their robustness and the objectivity they bring to various medical procedures. Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examinations (HINE) is a set of physical tests that are carried out on infants in the age group of 3-24 months with neurological disorders. However, these tests are graded through visual observations, which can be highly subjective. Therefore, computer vision-aided approach can be used to assist the experts in the grading process. In this paper, we present a method of automatic exercise classification through visual analysis of the HINE videos recorded at hospitals. We have used scale-invariant-feature-transform features to generate a bag-of-words from the image frames of the video sequences. Frequency of these visual words is then used to classify the video sequences using HMM. We also present a method of event segmentation in long videos containing more than two exercises. Event segmentation coupled with a classifier can help in automatic indexing of long and continuous video sequences of the HINE set. Our proposed framework is a step forward in the process of automation of HINE tests through computer vision-based methods. We conducted tests on a dataset comprising of 70 HINE video sequences. It has been found that the proposed method can successfully classify exercises with accuracy as high as 84%. The proposed work has direct applications in automatic or semiautomatic analysis of vertical suspension and ventral suspension tests of HINE.

A AvaliacAo dos Movimentos Gerais de Prechtl (AMG) durante o periodo fidgety (10-20 semanas de idade corrigida) teve a maior sensibilidade: 97% (intevalo de confianca [IC] 95% 93-99%) e especificidade: 89% (IC 95% 83-93%). A sensibilidade e especificidade do AMG de Precthl durante o periodo whrithing (nascimento a 6 semanas) foram 93% (IC 95% 86-96%) e 59% (IC 95% 74-100%), respectivamente. Movimentos cramped-synchronized no periodo de writhing de acordo com Prechtl tiveram a melhor especificidade (sensibilidade: 70% [IC 95% 54-82%]; especificidade: 97% [IC 95% 74-100%]). O metodo de Hadders-Algra para avaliar movimentos gerais teve sensibilidade e especificidade agrupadas de 89% (IC 95% 66-97%) 81% (IC 95% 64-91%), respectivamente. A presenca de posturas assimetricas e qualidade/quantidade do movimento foram relatadas pelo Exame Neurologico do Lactente de Hammersmith, Exame Neurologico Neonatal de Hammersmith, e AvaliacAo dos Movimentos de Lactentes, mas tiveram pobres associacoes com a PC posteriormente. InterpretacAoOs movimentos de fidgety avaliados pelos AMG de Prechtl tiveram a mais forte validade preditiva para PC posteriormente, mas nAo podem ser considerados isoladamente por causa da presenca de resultados falsos positivos. What this paper adds Fidgety general movements (Prechtl) are most predictive for later cerebral palsy compared with other spontaneous movements. False positive results are high among all spontaneous movement assessments.

Previous studies provided excellent sensitivity and specificity for each test in isolation, but no study has examined the pooled predictive power for early diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective case-control study of 441 high-risk infants born between 2003 and 2014, from three Italian hospitals. Infants with either a normal outcome, mild disability, or CP at two years, were matched for birth year, gender, and gestational age. Three-month HINE, GMA, and neuroimaging were retrieved from medical records. Logistic regression was conducted with log-likelihood and used to determine the model fit and Area Under the Curve (AUC) for accuracy. Results: Sensitivity and specificity for detecting CP were 88% and 62% for three-month HINE, 95% and 97% for absent fidgety GMs, and 79% and 99% for neuroimaging. The combined predictive power of all three assessments gave sensitivity and specificity values of 97.86% and 99.22% (PPV 98.56%, NPV 98.84%). Conclusion: CP can be accurately detected in high-risk infants when these test findings triangulate.

Video images of spontaneous movements were recorded in very preterm infants at the term-equivalent age. The Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) was performed in infants at 4 months of corrected age. Joint positional data were extracted using a pretrained pose-estimation model. Complexity and similarity indices of joint angle and angular velocity in terms of sample entropy and Pearson correlation coefficient were compared between the infants with HINE < 60 and >= 60. Video images of spontaneous movements were recorded in 65 preterm infants at term-equivalent age. Complexity indices of joint angles and angular velocities differed between the infants with HINE < 60 and >= 60 and correlated positively with HINE scores in most of the joints at the upper and lower extremities (p < 0.05). Similarity indices between each joint angle or joint angular velocity did not differ between the two groups in most of the joints at the upper and lower extremities. Quantitative assessments of spontaneous movements in preterm infants are feasible using a deep learning algorithm and sample entropy.

Aims: The purpose of this study was to identify the early occurrence of neurodevelopmental differences, between very preterm, late preterm and term born infants and the possible influence of the gender on the neurodevelopment in early infancy. Methods: A total of 188 low-risk infants, 69 very preterms, 71 late-preterms, and 48 term infants were assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12 months corrected age using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). At two years of age infants performed the Mental Developmental Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Results: The main results indicate that both very preterms and late-preterms showed significant lower global scores than term born infants at each evaluation (p < 0.001) at HINE and namely, at 3 months for the subsections cranial nerve and posture and at every age for tone; no gender differences has been evidenced in neurological performances. At the MDI, very preterms showed significant lower scores (p < 0.01) than both late-preterm and term born infants; gender differences were observed for preterms only (very and late), with best performances for females.

Method We followed children with CZS-associated microcephaly in an outpatient clinic in Salvador, Brazil. Neurological and neurodevelopmental assessments were performed using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Neurodevelopment (Bayley-III) respectively. Results Of the 42 children included, 19 were male (45.2%); median (interquartile range) age at neurological evaluation was 28 (25-32) months, and 36 (85.7%) had severe microcephaly. HINE and Bayley-III results were completed for 35/42 (83.3%) and 33/42 (78.5%) children respectively. Bayley-III identified a severe developmental delay in 32/33 (97.0%) children while 1/33 (3.0%) had only a mild delay. In the multivariable analysis, we found that Bayley-III and HINE scores were correlated. Better HINE scores were associated with higher Bayley-III cognitive raw scores (beta = 0.29; CI 95% = 0.02-0.57) and motor raw scores (beta = 0.43; CI 95% = 0.04-0.82) after adjusting for head circumference, prematurity, and age at neurodevelopmental evaluation.

Early detection of NDD enables infants to be fast-tracked to early intervention services, optimising outcomes. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants may experience early life factors increasing their risk of neurodevelopmental vulnerability, which persist into later childhood, further compounding the health inequities experienced by First Nations peoples in Australia. The LEAP-CP prospective cohort study will investigate the efficacy of early screening programmes, implemented in Queensland, Australia to earlier identify Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants who are 'at risk' of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (NDO) or NDD. Diagnostic accuracy and feasibility of early detection tools for identifying infants 'at risk' of a later diagnosis of adverse NDO or NDD will be determined. Methods and analysis Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander infants born in Queensland, Australia (birth years 2020-2022) will be invited to participate. Infants aged <9 months corrected age (CA) will undergo screening using the (1) General Movements Assessment (GMA); (2) Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE); (3) Rapid Neurodevelopmental Assessment (RNDA) and (4) Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Aboriginal adaptation (ASQ-TRAK).

These tests help in assessing neurophysiological development of babies, especially preterm infants who are born before (the fetus reaches) the gestational age of 36 weeks. Such tests are often conducted in the follow-up clinics of hospitals for grading infants with suspected disabilities. Assessment based on HINE depends on the expertise of the physicians involved in conducting the examinations. It has been noted that some of these tests, especially pulled-to-sit and lateral tilting, are difficult to assess solely based on visual observation. For example, during the pulled-to-sit examination, the examiner needs to observe the relative movement of the head with respect to torso while pulling the infant by holding wrists. The examiner may find it difficult to follow the head movement from the coronal view. Video object tracking based automatic or semi-automatic analysis can be helpful in this case. In this paper, we present a video based method to automate the analysis of pulled-to-sit examination. In this context, a dynamic programming and node pruning based efficient video object tracking algorithm has been proposed. Pulled-to-sit event detection is handled by the proposed tracking algorithm that uses a 2-D geometric model of the scene. The algorithm has been tested with normal as well as marker based videos of the examination recorded at the neuro-development clinic of the SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, India. It is found that the proposed algorithm is capable of estimating the pulled-to-sit score with sensitivity (80%-92%) and specificity (89%-96%).",,,,,"Sural, Shamik/C-1394-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1534-4320,1558-0210,,,,JAN,2012,20.0,1,,,,,38,47,,10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2172223,0,,,,,,,,22157070.0000,,,,,WOS:000299512300006,0.0

Although they are prone to developmental delays, reports on neurological outcome during the first 2 years of life are scarce. The aim of the study was to assess neurological/neuromotor outcome in high risk late preterm infants at 6 and 12 months corrected age and the change in neurological scores over time, and to identify factors associated with the neurological outcome. The Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination was performed in a cohort of 157 late preterm infants admitted in the NICU. The infants were examined at 6 and 12 months corrected age respectively and scored with the optimality score system including 26 items assessing cranial nerve function, posture, movements, tone and reflexes. Also parents reported neurological milestones in the follow up visit. Infants at 6 months had a global score of 59 (47-76) and optimal scores achieved in 25.4%. At 12 months they had a global score of 70 (58-78) and achieved optimal scores in 63.2%. The subscores of posture, tone and reflexes gradually increased from 6 to 12 months corrected age. Being born small for gestational age was the only factor that adversely influenced HINE score at 6 and 12 months. At 12 months 58.5% achieved independent walking.

Study design: A total of 53 term infants fulfilling the criteria for HIE underwent scanning within 4 weeks from delivery with a 1 Tesla HPQ magnet. The scores from the neurologic examination performed between 9 to 14 months were correlated to the neonatal magnetic resonance imaging findings and to the maximal locomotor function defined at the ages of 2 and 4 years. Results: The scores were always optimal in the infants with normal or minor neonatal magnetic resonance imaging findings. The lowest scores were associated with severe basal ganglia and white matter lesions. hll the infants who had a global score between 67 and 78 at 1 year were able to walk independently at 2 years and without restrictions at 4 years. Scores between 40 and 67 were associated with restricted mobility and scores <40 with severely limited self-mobility at 2 and 4 years.

Aims: To establish the range and frequency distribution of neonatal neurological scores in a large cohort of low risk late-preterm infants and the possible differences with full-term infants. Methods: Three hundred-seventy-five healthy infants born between 34 and 36 weeks gestational age (GA) without major brain lesions were assessed between 39 and 41 weeks post-menstrual age using the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurologic Assessment and compared to the scores obtained using the same examination in full-term infants. Results: Infants born at 35 and 36 weeks GA had similar median scores in 32 of the 34 items. Infants born at 34 weeks GA had a different profile of scores compared to those born at 35 and 36 weeks, mainly in the tone items. While in infants born at 34 weeks the assessment at term age showed similar median scores to those obtained in full-term infants in 25/34 items, in those born at 35 and 36 GA the number of scores similar to full-term infants increased to 29/34. The main differences involved the tone items, with more marked flexor tone in the limbs and better head control for those born at 35 and 36 weeks. Conclusions: This data can help as reference data when examining late-preterm infants at term age to see where the individual child stands compared to age matched low risk infants and to identify signs that are outside the reported range in infants with lesions or other risk factors.

The secondary aim was to evaluate which standardised neurobehavioural/neurological assessments were currently being implemented, and the existing practice in relation to their use. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey, sampling 179 eligible public and private hospital neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and special care nurseries (SCNs) throughout Australia and New Zealand, was purpose-developed and administered electronically from the 5th April to 23rd July 2013. Results: A total of 117 units (65%) overall, and 26 of 26 (100%) NICUs responded to the survey. NICUs had more neurodevelopmental allied health staff than SCNs, with physiotherapists and speech pathologists the most common disciplines. Physiotherapists were more likely to administer standardised neurobehavioural/neurological assessments in NICUs, while medical staff were more likely to do so in SCNs. A wide variety of standardised neurobehavioural/neurological assessment tools were used, with Prechtl's General Movements Assessment the most common in the NICUs (50%) and the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination the most common in the special care units (25%). Standardised neurobehavioural assessments were not administered in 22% of SCNs.

Study design: infants were enrolled from the Intensive Care Unit of the University of Catania. inclusion criteria were a gestational age below 37 weeks and the absence of genetic disorders. All infants underwent serial ultrasound and at 3 months performed both the GMs assessment and the Hammersmith Infant Neurologic Examination (HINE). Outcome was assessed at 2 years by the Touwen neurologic examination and the Clinical Adaptive Test/Clinical, Linguistic and Auditory Milestone Scale. Results: The integration of the two methods was shown to be more effective than the single assessments in predicting neurologic outcome. The additional benefit of combining the two approaches was particularly clear for the discrimination between unilateral and bilateral cerebral palsy. Conclusions: The integrated use of a scorable neurological examination and Prechtl's assessment of GMs can improve early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants and should complement other clinical and instrumental exams in follow-up programs.

Image segmentation, thinning and feature point based object tracking are used for automating the analysis. Segmentation outputs are processed with a novel region merging algorithm. It is found that the refined segmentation outputs can successfully be used to extract features in the context of the application under consideration. Next, a heuristic based filtering algorithm is applied on the thinned structures for locating necessary points to measure adductors angle. A semi-automatic scheme based on the object tracking of a video has been proposed to minimize errors of the image based analysis. It is observed that the video-based analysis outperforms the image-based method. A fully automatic method has also been proposed and compared with the semi-automatic algorithm. The proposed methods have been tested with several videos recorded from hospitals and the results have been found to be satisfactory in the present context. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Study design: Eighty preterm infants (50 receiving standard-of-care and 30 receiving the SENSE program) born <= 32 weeks gestation were enrolled within the first week of life in a prospective quasi-experimental design, using a historical control group for comparison. Standard-of-care consisted of tactile (skin-to-skin, touch, holding) and olfactory (scent cloth, close maternal contact) interventions as determined to be appropriate by health care professionals and parents. The SENSE group received specific doses of tactile (skin-to-skin care, holding, massage, touch), auditory (human speech, music), olfactory (scent cloth, close maternal contact), kinesthetic/vestibular (movement, rocking/transfers), and visual (dim or cycled light) exposures, based on the infant's postmenstrual age and tailored to medical status and infant cues according to the SENSE program. The SENSE program includes the intentional delivery of positive, age-appropriate sensory exposures by parents (or a sensory support team, when parents are unavailable) each day of NICU hospitalization. Infant neurobehavioral outcome, as well as maternal mental health and confidence, were assessed prior to NICU discharge, using standardized measures. Results: Seventy-three infants were included in the final analysis. Mothers whose infants received the SENSE program demonstrated higher scores on the Maternal Confidence Questionnaire (p = 0.01).

Heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation were recorded during clustered nursing cares and during standardised neurobehavioural assessments (including the General Movements Assessment, Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination and Premie-Neuro Assessment). Two assessors extracted HR and oxygen saturations at 5 s intervals, with HR instability defined either as tachycardia (HR >180 beats per minute (bpm)) or bradycardia (HR <100 bpm). Oxygen desaturations were defined as SpO(2)<90%. Physiological stability was compared between nursing cares and neurobehavioural assessments using linear (for continuous outcomes) and logistic (HR instability and oxygen desaturation) regression. Results Compared with clustered nursing cares HR was lower (mean difference -5.9 bpm; 95% CI -6.5 to 5.3; P<0.001) and oxygen saturation higher (mean difference 2.4%; 95% CI 2.1% to 2.6%; P<0.001) during standardised neurobehavioural assessments. Compared with clustered nursing cares neurobehavioural assessments were also associated with reduced odds of tachycardia (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86), HR instability (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85) and oxygen desaturation (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.70). Conclusions Standardised neurobehavioural assessments are associated with less physiological stress than clustered nursing cares in infants aged 29-32 weeks' postmenstrual age, and are therefore possible without causing undue physiological disturbance in medically stable infants.",,,,,,"Dawson, Jennifer/0000-0003-2357-6283; Doyle, Lex/0000-0002-7667-7312",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2399-9772,,,,NOV,2017,1.0,1,,,,,,,e000025,10.1136/bmjpo-2017-000025,0,,,,,,,,29637097.0000,,,,,WOS:000641975700015,0.0

The best instruments for early detection of cerebral palsy (CP) with or without intellectual disability are neonatal magnetic resonance imaging, general movements assessment at 2-4 months and from 2-4 months onwards, the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination and Standardized Infant NeuroDevelopmental Assessment. Early detection of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is difficult; its first signs emerge at the end of the first year. Prediction with the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers and Infant Toddler Checklist is possible to some extent and improves during the second year, especially in children at familial risk of ASD. Thus, prediction improves substantially when transient brain structures have been replaced by permanent circuitries. At around 3 months the cortical subplate has dissolved in primary motor and sensory cortices; around 12 months the cortical subplate in prefrontal and parieto-temporal cortices and cerebellar external granular layer have disappeared. This review stresses that families are pivotal in early intervention. It summarizes evidence on the effectiveness of early intervention in medically fragile neonates, infants at low to moderate risk, infants with or at high risk of CP and with or at high risk of ASD.",,,,,"Hadders-Algra, Mijna/AAM-9180-2021","Hadders-Algra, Mijna/0000-0001-6845-5114",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2077-0383,,,,FEB,2021,10.0,4,,,,,,,861,10.3390/jcm10040861,0,,,,,,,,33669727.0000,,,,,WOS:000624049500001,0.0

Aims: To assess a cohort of low risk term born newborns within the first 6 h and at 48 h after birth using the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination. Study design and subjects: A population of low risk term born newborns was examined within 3 h from birth or between 3 and 6 h. Each infant was re-assessed at 48 h, establishing the range and frequency distribution of neonatal neurological scores at each time point. Results: Of the 124 full-term born newborns, 62 were assessed at 0-3 h and 62 at 3-6 h. All infants were re-assessed at 48 h. For 23/34 of the neurological items, the range and median scores were similar across the 3 time points. In the remaining 11 items the three groups had a similar range of scores but the median scores were different with different rates of changes. In 6 of the 11 the median scores at 3-6 h were similar to those observed at 48 h but they appeared to be 'less mature' at 0-3 h. Only in one item the median scores were consistently different at the 3 time points. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a neurological examination can already be reliably performed soon after birth. These findings will help in the interpretation of the few items that show changes with increasing postnatal age. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Methods This study comprises two substudies: (1) a study of the predictive validity of the GMs and HINE for detecting CP; (2) randomised, double-blinded controlled trial of a novel intervention delivered through peer trainers (Community Disability Workers, CDW) compared with health advice (15 fortnightly visits). 142 infants at high risk of CP ('absent fidgety' GMs; 'high risk score' on HINE) aged 12-40weeks CA will he recruited to the intervention substudy, with infants randomised based on a computer generated sequence. Researchers will be masked to group allocation, and caregivers and CDWs naive to intervention status. Visits will include therapeutic modules (goal directed active motor/cognitive strategies and LEAP-CP games) and parent education. Health advice is based on the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, WHO. Infants will he evaluated at baseline, post intervention and 18 months CA.

Method Using data from the registry of patients with SMA1 treated with nusinersen, we compared the subgroups of sitters and non-sitters after 14 months of therapy as a function of baseline level, SMN2 copy number, age at treatment initiation, and improvement at 2 and 6 months post-treatment initiation. We used Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination, Section 2 (HINE-2) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders for motor evaluation. Results Fifty children (22 females, 28 males), mean age 22 months (SD 20.7; range 2.5-102.8mo) were treated. Data on sitting position acquisition were collected for 47 patients at month 14. Fifteen patients were able to sit unassisted; 11 of 15 had a baseline HINE-2 score of at least 2 points and 11 of 14 had an improvement over baseline of at least 2 points at month 6.

It is estimated that 3 in 4 have chronic pain and 1 in 5 have a sleep disorder, with the highest frequency and severity occurring in children with the greatest impairment. Sleep impairment and pain can adversely impact activities, participation and quality of life; however, prevalence of these symptoms in children at risk for CP < 2 years of age remain unknown. The objective of this project was to develop a baseline understanding of the presence of sleep and pain symptoms among children <2 years at high risk for CP to establish a baseline estimate for future quality improvement initiatives. A retrospective chart review was performed on a convenience sample of 50 children <2 years of age that were determined to be high risk for CP. This was determined through a standardized Hammersmith Infant Neurological Evaluation (HINE) global score of less than 56 performed as part of routine care. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the sample. A nonparametric test was used to evaluate the differences between groups. Pain and sleep problems were frequently reported in our sample (38% sleep problems and 32% pain). There were also significant differences between reported symptoms and the HINE. Reported symptoms were associated with lower HINE scores. Sleep and pain are frequent symptoms in children at risk for cerebral palsy.

Provision of early intervention is dependent upon accurate, early identification of infants at risk of adverse outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging at term equivalent age combined with General Movements assessment at 12 weeks corrected age is currently the most accurate method for early prediction of cerebral palsy at 12 months corrected age. To date no studies have compared the use of earlier magnetic resonance imaging combined with neuromotor and neurobehavioural assessments (at 30 weeks postmenstrual age) to predict later motor and neurodevelopmental outcomes including cerebral palsy (at 12-24 months corrected age). This study aims to investigate i) the relationship between earlier brain imaging and neuromotor/neurobehavioural assessments at 30 and 40 weeks postmenstrual age, and ii) their ability to predict motor and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 3 and 12 months corrected age. Methods/design: This prospective cohort study will recruit 80 preterm infants born <= 30 week's gestation and a reference group of 20 healthy term born infants from the Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. Infants will undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging at approximately 30 and 40 weeks postmenstrual age to develop our understanding of very early brain structure at 30 weeks and maturation that occurs between 30 and 40 weeks postmenstrual age. A combination of neurological (Hammersmith Neonatal Neurologic Examination), neuromotor (General Movements, Test of Infant Motor Performance), neurobehavioural (NICU Network Neurobehavioural Scale, Premie-Neuro) and visual assessments will be performed at 30 and 40 weeks postmenstrual age to improve our understanding of the relationship between brain structure and function. These data will be compared to motor assessments at 12 weeks corrected age and motor and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 months corrected age (neurological assessment by paediatrician, Bayley scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Alberta Infant Motor Scale, Neurosensory Motor Developmental Assessment) to differentiate atypical development (including cerebral palsy and/or motor delay). Discussion: Earlier identification of those very preterm infants at risk of adverse neurodevelopmental and motor outcomes provides an additional period for intervention to optimise outcomes.",,,,,"Kong, Annice/Q-4283-2018; Coulthard, Alan/C-3649-2011; Pannek, Kerstin/C-8059-2011; Viani, Rafael/V-1196-2018; George, Joanne Margaret/R-3812-2016; Rose, Stephen/C-8044-2009; Ware, Robert S./B-2024-2014; Fripp, Jurgen/A-8763-2011; Boyd, Roslyn N/A-4498-2011; Colditz, Paul B/F-6772-2010","Kong, Annice/0000-0003-3118-7376; Coulthard, Alan/0000-0003-1110-9207; Pannek, Kerstin/0000-0002-6512-7630; George, Joanne Margaret/0000-0003-4893-6564; Ware, Robert S./0000-0002-6129-6736; Fripp, Jurgen/0000-0001-9705-0079; Boyd, Roslyn N/0000-0002-4919-5975; Colditz, Paul B/0000-0002-6408-8238; Rose, Stephen/0000-0003-1558-6297",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2431,,,,SEP 16,2015,15.0,,,,,,,,123,10.1186/s12887-015-0439-z,0,,,,,,,,26377791.0000,,,,,WOS:000361508400004,0.0

We normalized the extracted T2-weighted imaging data to a standard neonate template space, and segmented them into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The comparison of gray matter volume was conducted between the two groups. Results A total of five neonates with COVID-19 were included in this study. The median reflex scores were 2 points lower in the infected group than in the control group (P = 0.0094), and the median orientation and behavior scores were 2.5 points lower in the infected group than in the control group (P = 0.0008). There were also significant differences between the two groups in the total scale score (P = 0.0426).

Methods: Pregnant women presenting at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana were recruited into this prospective observational study. Malaria exposure was determined by clinically documented antenatal malaria infection; parasitemia in maternal, placental, or umbilical cord blood; or placental histology. Neurological functioning was assessed using the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination within 48 hours of birth. Performance was classified as optimal or suboptimal by subdomain and overall. Results: Between November 21, 2018 and February 10, 2019, a total of 211 term-born neonates, of whom 27 (13%) were exposed to malaria in pregnancy, were included. In the reflexes subdomain, exposed neonates tended to score lower (adjusted mean difference-0.34, 95% confidence interval-0.70 to 0.03), with an increased risk (adjusted risk ratio 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 2.44) of suboptimal performance compared with unexposed neonates. There were no significant between-group differences in scores or optimality classification for the remaining subdomains and overall. Conclusions: Malaria-exposed neonates had similar neurological functioning relative to unexposed neonates, with differences confined to the reflexes subdomain, suggesting potential underlying neurological immaturity or injury. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and determine the significance of malaria in pregnancy on long-term neurological outcomes. (c) 2021 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the neurodevelopmental abilities of 2-year-old children who were born preterm and who had no evidence of focal abnormality on conventional MR imaging were consistently linearly related to specific local changes in white matter microstructure. We studied 33 children, born at a median (range) gestational age of 28(5) (24(4)32(1)) weeks. The children were recruited as infants from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Queen Charlottes and Hammersmith Hospital in the early neonatal period and imaged at a median corrected age of 25.5 (2427) months. The children underwent diffusion tensor imaging to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) as a measure of tissue microstructure, and neurodevelopmental assessment using the Griffiths Mental Development Scales [giving an overall developmental quotient (DQ) and sub-quotients scores for motor, personalsocial, hearinglanguage, eyehand coordination and performance scales] at 2 years corrected age. Tract-based spatial statistics with linear regression analysis of voxel-wise cross-subject statistics were used to assess the relationship between FA and DQ/sub-quotient scores and results confirmed by reduced major axis regression of regions with significant correlations. We found that DQ was linearly related to FA values in parts of the corpus callosum; performance sub-scores to FA values in the corpus callosum and right cingulum; and eyehand coordination sub-scores to FA values in the cingulum, fornix, anterior commissure, corpus callosum and right uncinate fasciculus. This study shows that specific neurodevelopmental impairments in infants born preterm are precisely related to microstructural abnormalities in particular regions of cerebral white matter which are consistent between individuals. FA may aid prognostication and provide a biomarker for therapeutic or mechanistic studies of preterm brain injury.",,,,,"counsell, serena j/I-9012-2014; Boardman, James/K-5472-2015; Hajnal, Joseph/P-6251-2018","rutherford, mary/0000-0003-3361-1337; Edwards, Anthony David/0000-0003-4801-7066; Hajnal, Joseph/0000-0002-2690-5495; Boardman, James/0000-0003-3904-8960; Counsell, Serena/0000-0002-8033-5673",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8950,1460-2156,,,,DEC,2008,131.0,,12.0,,,,3201,3208,,10.1093/brain/awn268,0,,,,,,,,18952670.0000,,,,,WOS:000261996700011,0.0

It is important to describe the functional outcomes seen with congenital infections to allow for their recognition and appropriate interventions. We evaluated 120 children conceived during the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in Paraiba, Brazil, who were approximately 24 months old, to assess functional outcomes. All children met either anthropometric criteria or laboratory criteria suggestive of possible congenital Zika virus infection. We collected results of previous medical evaluations, interviewed parents, and performed physical examinations and functional assessments, for example, the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). We compared patterns of neurologic outcomes and developmental delay at age 24 months by whether children met anthropometric or laboratory criteria, or both. Among children meeting both criteria, 60% (26/43) were multiply affected (had severe motor impairment, severe developmental delay, and suboptimal HINE scores), compared with 5% (3/57) meeting only laboratory criteria and none (0/20) meeting only anthropometric criteria. Of the remaining 91 children, 49% (45) had developmental delay, with more severe delay seen in children meeting both criteria. Although children meeting physical and laboratory criteria for potential congenital Zika virus infection were more severely affected, we did identify several children with notable adverse neurologic outcomes and developmental delay with no physical findings but potential laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection.

Nusinersen, with its quick onset of action, can benefit patients early in the treatment course. However, there are currently no clinical studies regarding the improvement in motor function and nutritional status of patients after loading period treatment with nusinersen. Here, we aimed to determine the efficacy of nusinersen in improving motor function and nutritional status in children with SMA treated with nusinersen after loading period in Western China.MethodsIn this retrospective study, data for all pediatric patients (aged < 18 years), with genetically confirmed diagnosis of SMA who were treated with nusinersen, were collected before initiation of treatment and after 2 months of treatment. We assessed motor function using standardized scales and nutritional status of patients with SMA as well as side effects of nusinersen.ResultsForty-six pediatric patients aged < 18 years were enrolled in this study. After 2 months of treatment, the motor function of patients with SMA type 1, 2, and 3 improved. The difference in Revised Upper Limb Module scores from M0 to M2 was significant in patients with SMA type 2 and 3 (P = 0.004, P = 0.042, respectively). The difference in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded scores from M0 to M2 in patients with SMA type 2 was also significant (P = 0.000). No significant differences were found for Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorder (CHOP-INTEND), Hammersmith Infant Neurologic Examination-Part 2 (HINE-2), and 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) scores between M0 and M2, but the scores of CHOP-INTEND, HINE-2, and 6MWT were all increased after loading period treatment. The overall improvement in nutritional status was not statistically significant. No serious adverse effects were observed.ConclusionsOur study provides evidence for the efficacy and safety of nusinersen and the nutritional status of pediatric patients with SMA after the loading period treatment.

We aimed to determine diagnosis age, fidelity to recommended tests and acceptability to parents and referrers of an early diagnosis clinic to implement a recent evidence-based clinical guideline for the early diagnosis of CP. A prospective observational case series of infants <12 months with detectable risks for CP attending our clinic was completed with data analysed cross-sectionally. Infants had a high risk of CP diagnosis at a mean age of 4.4 (standard deviation [SD] 2.3) months and CP diagnosis at 8.5 [4.1] months. Of the 109 infants seen, 57% had a diagnosis of CP or high risk of CP, showing high specificity to our inclusion criteria. Parent and referrer acceptability of the clinic was high. Paediatricians had the highest rate of referral (39%) followed by allied health (31%), primary carer (14%) and other health workers (16%). Fidelity to the guideline was also high. All infants referred <5 mths had the General Movements Assessment (GMA) and all except one had the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) administered. n = 92 (84%) of infants seen had neuroimaging, including n = 53 (49%) who had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), showing recommended tests are feasible. Referral to CP-specific interventions was at 4.7 [3.0] months, sometimes before referral to clinic. Clinicians can be confident CP can be diagnosed well under 12 months using recommended tools. This clinic model is acceptable to parents and referrers and supports access to CP-specific early interventions when they are likely to be most effective.",,,,,"Novak, Iona E/B-3061-2014","Novak, Iona E/0000-0001-6001-4867",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-3425,,,,AUG,2021,11.0,8,,,,,,,1074,10.3390/brainsci11081074,0,,,,,,,,34439692.0000,,,,,WOS:000689039900001,0.0

We aimed to investigate the relationship between neonatal temperature at admission and the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) at one month of age in a low-resource setting. Methods: This retrospective study included all inborn neonates admitted to the Special Care Unit of Tosamaganga Hospital (Tanzania) between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2020. The neurological examination at one month of age was performed using the Hammersmith method. The relationship between the admission temperature and the risk of CP was investigated using logistic regression models, with temperature modeled as the non-linear term. Results: High/moderate risk of CP was found in 40/119 (33.6%) of the neonates at one month of age. A non-linear relationship between the admission temperature and moderate/high risk of CP at one month of age was found. The lowest probability of moderate/high risk of CP was estimated at admission temperatures of between 35 and 36 degrees C, with increasing probability when departing from such temperatures. Conclusions: In a low-resource setting, we found a U-shaped relationship between the admission temperature and the risk of CP at one month of life. Expanding the analysis of the follow-up data to 12-24 months of age would be desirable in order to confirm and strengthen such findings.",,,,,,"Putoto, Giovanni/0000-0003-0256-1744; Trevisanuto, Danieel/0000-0002-6462-0079",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2227-9067,,,,MAR,2022,9.0,3,,,,,,,352,10.3390/children9030352,0,,,,,,,,35327724.0000,,,,,WOS:000776973600001,0.0

The proposed algorithm has been used successfully to analyze one of the complex infant neurological examinations often referred to as Hammersmith lateral tilting test. This is an important test of the infant neurological assessment process, and this test is difficult to grade by visual observation. It has been shown in this paper that the proposed video object tracking algorithm can be used to analyze the videos of fast moving objects by incorporating application-specific information. For example, the proposed tracking algorithm can be used to assess lateral tilting test of the Hammersmith infant neurological examinations. The algorithm has been tested with several video recordings of this test which were captured at the neurodevelopment clinic of the SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, India during the period of the study. It is found that the proposed algorithm is capable of estimating the score for the test with high values of sensitivity and specificity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-0118,1741-0444,,,,SEP,2014,52.0,9,,,,,759,772,,10.1007/s11517-014-1178-2,0,,,,,,,,25096789.0000,,,,,WOS:000340683800005,0.0

Methods: Data on 69 children with cerebral palsy associated with CZ, followed in a neurorehabilitation hospital, who consecutively attended the neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years of age, were collected. Bayley III Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination, and Gross Motor Function Classification System were used for the outcome evaluation. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis were performed. Results: The median age at follow-up was of 24.0 (23-32) months. Only 3 (4.3%) children were not microcephalic. The majority presented with bilateral (94.2%), spastic (100.0%), Gross Motor Function Classification System grade IV or V (92.8%) cerebral palsy, epilepsy (73.1%), extremely low performances on cognitive (94.2%), language (95.7%), and motor (95.7%) Bayley-III Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Test scores. The median Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination score was of 21.0 (range 9-75).

We investigated microstructural differences using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) among VPT infants with different grades of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), their association with early motor function and temperament ratings, and the potential moderating effect of IVH severity on the above structure-function relations. Methods Fifty-seven VPT (<= 32 weeks gestational age) infants with IVH (Low Grade (Papile grading I/II): 42; High Grade (III/IV): 15) were studied. DTI was acquired between 39 and 44 weeks postmenstrual age and was analyzed using the tract-based spatial statistics approach. Early motor function and temperament were assessed at 3-month corrected age based on the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) and Infant Behavioral Questionnaire - Revised, Short Version (IBQ-R-S), respectively. Results Significantly lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean, axial, and/or radial diffusivity were found in VPT infants with High Grade IVH compared to Low Grade IVH (p < 0.05). Significant associations were found between DTI metrics and motor function in both IVH groups and between DTI and Fear temperament ratings in the High Grade IVH Group (all p < 0.05). IVH severity had a significant moderating effect on the relation between DTI and motor and Fear ratings (p < 0.05). Conclusion DTI is a sensitive neuroimaging biomarker providing a refined understanding of the impact and location of differing severities of IVH on the developing white matter of VPT infants.

There was no significant difference between the infants born at 35 and 36 weeks gestation. When compared to term infants assessed at the same age intervals, our cohort showed a wider variability of scores. Mean and loth percentile for global scores were lower than those reported for term infants suggesting that when assessing infants born at 35 and 36 weeks the optimality scores used for infants born full-term should not be used as normative data.

Motor impairment after neonatal and childhood-onset ischemic stroke (IS) is common, although the prevalence and type of hemiparesis differs between the 2 age groups. Lesion topography is an important predictor of hemiparesis after neonatal IS, but it is not known if the same topographic predictors of adverse motor outcome apply to childhood-onset IS. We used a consistent approach to define lesion topography and evaluate motor outcome in both age groups to (1) investigate whether early topographic predictors of hemiparesis after unilateral middle cerebral artery-territory stroke are the same in neonates and older children and (2) compare the prevalence of dystonia and loss of independent finger movements between the 2 age groups. Design. Twenty-eight patients with neonatal-onset IS (Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom) were studied together with 43 patients with childhood-onset IS (Great Ormond Street Hospital, United Kingdom). All patients had exclusive unilateral middle cerebral artery-territory IS. Lesion topography was studied by using the first magnetic resonance image acquired after the onset of symptoms and was coded for involvement of cerebral cortex (CC), posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC), basal ganglia (BG), and white matter. The primary outcome was hemiparesis, and secondary outcomes were dystonia and loss of age-appropriate independent finger movements. Results. Hemiparesis was more common after childhood-onset IS (56%) than neonatal-onset IS (24%). In neonatal-onset IS, concomitant involvement of BG, CC, and PLIC predicts the development of hemiparesis (odds ratio: 99; 95% confidence interval: 5.2-1883.8), and no child with 1 or 2 of these structures involved developed hemiparesis. In contrast, in childhood-onset IS, concomitant BG, and PLIC lesions tended to be associated with hemiparesis (9 of 11), but this adverse outcome was seen also among patients with 1- or 2-site involvement. However, hemiparesis was less likely if the infarction involved BG only (odds ratio: 0.162; 95% confidence interval: 0.036-0.729). Dystonia was present in 15 of 24 in the childhood-onset group with hemiparesis but was not seen after neonatal-onset IS. In both age groups upper-limb impairment was more severe than lower-limb impairment, with frequent loss of independent hand function among hemiparetic patients. Conclusions. In neonatal and childhood-onset IS, early magnetic resonance imaging provides useful prognostic information about subsequent motor outcome. There are differences in the functional response of the neuromotor system to injury between the 2 age groups that cannot be attributed to methodological differences alone.",,,,,"Boardman, James/K-5472-2015","Boardman, James/0000-0003-3904-8960",,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-4005,1098-4275,,,,FEB,2005,115.0,2,,,,,321,326,,10.1542/peds.2004-0427,0,,,,,,,,15687439.0000,,,,,WOS:000226725000028,0.0

Risdiplam is an orally administered small molecule that modifies SMN2 pre-messenger RNA splicing and increases levels of functional SMN protein in blood. Methods We conducted an open-label study of risdiplam in infants with type 1 SMA who were 1 to 7 months of age at enrollment. Part 1 of the study (published previously) determined the dose to be used in part 2 (reported here), which assessed the efficacy and safety of daily risdiplam as compared with no treatment in historical controls. The primary end point was the ability to sit without support for at least 5 seconds after 12 months of treatment. Key secondary end points were a score of 40 or higher on the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND; range, 0 to 64, with higher scores indicating better motor function), an increase of at least 4 points from baseline in the CHOP-INTEND score, a motor-milestone response as measured by Section 2 of the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE-2), and survival without permanent ventilation. For the secondary end points, comparisons were made with the upper boundary of 90% confidence intervals for natural-history data from 40 infants with type 1 SMA. Results A total of 41 infants were enrolled. After 12 months of treatment, 12 infants (29%) were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds, a milestone not attained in this disorder. The percentages of infants in whom the key secondary end points were met as compared with the upper boundary of confidence intervals from historical controls were 56% as compared with 17% for a CHOP-INTEND score of 40 or higher, 90% as compared with 17% for an increase of at least 4 points from baseline in the CHOP-INTEND score, 78% as compared with 12% for a HINE-2 motor-milestone response, and 85% as compared with 42% for survival without permanent ventilation (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The most common serious adverse events were pneumonia, bronchiolitis, hypotonia, and respiratory failure. Conclusions In this study involving infants with type 1 SMA, risdiplam resulted in higher percentages of infants who met motor milestones and who showed improvements in motor function than the percentages observed in historical cohorts. Longer and larger trials are required to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of risdiplam in infants with type 1 SMA. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche; FIREFISH ClinicalTrials.gov number, .)

Current standardised examinations are not designed for unwell or ventilated neonates, and it is unclear how confident paediatricians feel about the examination or what aspects they perform. Aim This study aimed to review the confidence of UK paediatricians on the neurological examination in unwell neonates, describe their attitudes towards it, and determine what could improve practice. Methods An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach (QUAN -> QUAL) with equal weighting between stages. A survey on attitudes to the neonatal neurological examination was sent to all UK neonatal units and members of the British Paediatric Neurology Association. Volunteers were sought for semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to interpret qualitative data, which was triangulated with quantitative questionnaire data. Results One hundred ninety-three surveys were returned, 31.0% from neonatologists, 9.3% paediatric neurologist. The median range for confidence was 4 (IQR3-5). Twenty-three interviews occurred. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: Current culture on neonatal units, Practicalities of the neurological examination in unwell neonates, and Changing the culture. Most interviewees did not feel confident performing or interpreting the neurological examination in unwell neonates. Many units had a culture of seeing it as low priority, did not see its relevance in the acute management of unwell neonates. A few interviewees worked in units with a positive culture towards the neurological examination who used adapted standardised examinations and provided training. 72% of questionnaire responders wanted a new standardised neurological examination designed for the unwell neonate, which should be short, utilise pictures like the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination, contain an assessment of consciousness, be developmentally appropriate and achievable in unwell, ventilated neonates, be accompanied by a schematic to aid interpretation, and for greater training and assessments of competence. Conclusions There are barriers preventing paediatricians being able to perform a neurological examination in unwell neonates, and a culture of neurophobia is common.

Thirty-three type I SMA infants, who classically do not achieve the ability to sit unsupported, were included in the study. Our results confirmed that all patients had a score of 0 out of a scale of 4 on items assessing sitting, rolling, crawling, standing or walking. A score of more than 0 was only achieved in three items: head control (n = 13), kicking (n = 15) and hand grasp (n = 18). In these items, the maximal score achieved was 1 out of a scale of 4, indicating only partial achievement of the milestone. Infants with symptom onset after 6 months of age had longer preservation of a score of 1 when compared to those with onset before 6 months of age. Our results suggest that even when current standards of care are applied, developmental milestones are rarely even partially achieved as part of natural history in type I SMA infants.

In 2018, Monash Children's Hospital established an Early Neurodevelopment Clinic based upon evidence-based guidelines for the early diagnosis of CP in high-risk infants. In this study, we aimed to characterise the infants presenting to the clinic and determine the rate of CP diagnosis. Methods This study analysed data from infants attending the Early Neurodevelopment Clinic between May 2019 and April 2020. Infants at high-risk for CP attended the clinic at 3 months corrected age. Neuroimaging reports were reviewed, and a Prechtl's General Movement Assessment and Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination were performed. Infants were diagnosed as having typical development, delayed development, high-risk of CP or CP at the time of clinic attendance and referred on to the appropriate pathway. Results Ninety-six high-risk infants attended the clinic over the 1 year study period. Sixty-eight (71%) infants were extremely preterm or extremely low birthweight, and 28 (29%) were infants at born at older gestation with evidence of moderate to severe brain injury. Nine (9.6%) infants received a CP diagnosis and 12 (12.5%) were considered high-risk of CP. All infants with CP or high-risk of CP were referred to the Victorian Paediatric Rehabilitation Service.

This rare event led to a more serious transfusion-dependent phenotype in a patient. It was successfully cured by haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods and Results A 9-year-old mainland Chinese male with a history of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia was diagnosed to have hemoglobin (Hb) Hammersmith. He required regular blood transfusion but was unable to be transfused to desired parameters for 8 years prior to transplant due to social and geographical reasons. He subsequently developed marrow hyperplasia and progressive splenomegaly (down to umbilicus level), suggestive of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Eventually, the family came to Hong Kong and complied to a more intensive transfusion regimen and preconditioning chemotherapy 3 months prior to transplant. He underwent haploidentical HSCT using paternal TCR alpha beta/CD45RA-depleted graft but suffered from graft rejection, despite splenic irradiation for massive splenomegaly. It was successfully salvaged with second HSCT with unmanipulated graft from the same donor with additional serotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions. Conclusion Allogenic haploidentical HSCT for hemoglobin Hammersmith is feasible but adequate immunosuppression during conditioning is crucial. Precise adoptive cell therapy can promote durable engraftment.",,,,,"Leung, Wing/HHD-3302-2022","Leung, Wing/0000-0002-2996-7229",,,,,,,,,,,,,1397-3142,1399-3046,,,,AUG,2022,26.0,5,,,,,,,e14278,10.1111/petr.14278,0,,APR 2022,,,,,,35396908.0000,,,,,WOS:000779584000001,0.0

We present the study's final analysis, assessing the efficacy and safety of nusinersen over 3 years. Methods This phase 2, open-label, multicentre, dose-escalation study was done in three university hospital sites in the USA and one in Canada. Infants aged between 3 weeks and 6 months with two or three SMN2 gene copies and infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy were eligible for inclusion. Eligible participants received multiple intrathecal loading doses of 6 mg equivalent nusinersen (cohort 1) or 12 mg dose equivalent (cohort 2), followed by maintenance doses of 12 mg equivalent nusinersen. The protocol amendment on Jan 25, 2016, changed the primary efficacy endpoint from safety and tolerability to reaching motor milestones, assessed using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination section 2 (HINE-2) at the last study visit, in all participants who successfully completed the loading dose period and day 92 assessment. The statistical analysis plan was amended on Feb 10, to include additional analyses of the subgroup of participants with two SMN2 copies. Adverse events were assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01839656). Findings Between May 3, 2013, and July 9, 2014, 20 symptomatic participants with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy (12 boys and 8 girls; median age at diagnosis 78 days [range 0-154]) were enrolled. Median time on study was 36.2 months (IQR 20.6-41.3). The primary endpoint of an incremental improvement in HINE-2 developmental motor milestones was reached by 12 (63%) of 19 evaluable participants. In the 13 participants with two SMN2 copies treated with 12 mg nusinersen, the HINE-2 motor milestone total score increased steadily from a baseline mean of 1.46 (SD 0.52) to 11.86 (6.18) at day 1135, representing a clinically significant change of 10.43 (6.05). At study closure (Aug 21, 2017), 15 (75%) of 20 participants were alive. 101 serious adverse events were reported in 16 (80%) of 20 participants; all five deaths (one in cohort 1 and four in cohort 2) were likely to be related to spinal muscular atrophy disease progression. Interpretation Our findings are consistent with other trials of nusinersen and show improved survival and attainment of motor milestones over 3 years in patients with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy, with a favourable safety profile.

Methods: A cohort of 102 preterm infants born at < 32 weeks gestation or with a birth weight of < 1500 g were assessed using the Hammersmith Term Neurological Examination. They underwent cranial ultrasound examinations according to local guidelines. The Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination was performed at 12 months corrected age. Scores for the term examinations were compared with scores derived from healthy infants born at term and with scores from low-risk preterm infants at term equivalent age. Term neurological scores and cranial ultrasound findings were compared in the prediction of 12-month neurological outcome. Results: Seventy-eight (76.5%) preterm infants had suboptimal total neurological scores at term when compared to healthy infants born at term. However, most went on to have optimal neurological scores at 12 months corrected age. When our cohort was compared with low-risk preterm infants at term equivalent age only 14 (13.7%) scored outside the normal range. Neither system of scoring predicted neurological outcome at 12 months corrected age as reliably as cranial ultrasound (sensitivity 0.83, specificity 0.87).

We performed the examination in a cohort of 103 very preterm infants (gestational age below 32 weeks) as early as 3 months' post-term age, and longitudinally at 6, 9 and 12 months. Our aim was to establish the frequency distribution of the optimality scores at each age period, to explore the predictive value of the examination from 3 months onwards as to developmental outcome and locomotor function at 2 years, and to explore its longitudinal consistency. Results: The results showed that this standardized neurological examination can be performed in preterm infants as early as 3 months' post-term age to predict motor outcome at 2 years. and that its high predictive value is consistent across the first year of life due to an effective combination of different items for each age period. Conclusions: We confirm the high predictive value of this neurological examination in very preterm infants after 9 months and extend it to the assessments performed as early as 3 months post-term. This is of great relevance as in very preterm infants early prediction of motor function is essential for a prompt planning of therapeutic interventions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The brain network changes that antecede the early development of CP in infants are not well characterized, and a better understanding may suggest new strategies for risk-stratification at term, which could lead to earlier access to therapies. Graph theoretical methods applied to diffusion MRI-derived brain connectomes may help quantify the organization and information transfer capacity of the preterm brain with greater nuance than overt structural or regional microstructural changes. Our aim was to shed light on the pathophysiology of early CP development, before the occurrence of early intervention therapies and other environmental confounders, to help identify the best early biomarkers of CP risk in VPT infants. In a cohort of 395 very preterm infants, we extracted cortical morphometrics and brain volumes from structural MRI and also applied graph theoretical methods to diffusion MRI connectomes, both acquired at term-equivalent age. Metrics from graph network analysis, especially global efficiency, strength values of the major sensorimotor tracts, and local efficiency of the motor nodes and novel non-motor regions were strongly inversely related to early CP diagnosis. These measures remained significantly associated with CP after correction for common risk factors of motor development, suggesting that metrics of brain network efficiency at term may be sensitive biomarkers for early CP detection. We demonstrate for the first time that in VPT infants, early CP diagnosis is anteceded by decreased brain network segregation in numerous nodes, including motor regions commonly-associated with CP and also novel regions that may partially explain the high rate of cognitive impairments concomitant with CP diagnosis. These advanced MRI biomarkers may help identify the highest risk infants by term-equivalent age, facilitating earlier interventions that are informed by early pathophysiological changes.",,,,,"Parikh, Nehal/AAB-9981-2022","Harpster, Karen/0000-0003-1677-6367",,,,,,,,,,,,,1053-8119,1095-9572,,,,DEC 15,2021,245.0,,,,,,,,118688,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118688,0,,NOV 2021,,,,,,34758381.0000,,,,,WOS:000736968100004,0.0

Among the 122 patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between December 2015 and September 2017, 67 patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive enteral nutrition with either HINE E-GEL (R) (HINE group; n = 33) or MEINR (R) (MEIN group; n = 34). The incidence of diarrhea was significantly lower in the HINE group (18.2 % vs. 64.7 %, P < 0.001). The score of Bristol scale of POD 6/7 was significantly lower in the HINE group (P = 0.019/P = 0.006, respectively). The completion rate of enteral nutrition regimen was significantly higher in theHINE group (97.4% vs. 86.6%, P= 0.002).

However, there were no significant differences in Prognostic Nutritional Index values, blood test results, rapid turnover proteins, body mass index, or body composition between the two groups. HINE E-GEL compared with MEIN may reduce the frequency of diarrhea, enabling patients to adhere to the scheduled enteral nutrition plan.

Expanded Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (HFMSE) and North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) may also be useful in this young DMD population. Clinical evaluators from the MDA-DMD Clinical Research Network were trained in these assessment tools. Infants and boys with DMD (n = 24; 1.9 +/- 0.7 years) were assessed. The mean Bayley III motor composite score was low (82.8 +/- 8; p <= .0001) (normal = 100 +/- 15). Mean gross motor and fine motor function scaled scores were low (both p <= .0001). The mean cognitive comprehensive (p = .0002), receptive language (p <= .0001), and expressive language (p = .0001) were also low compared to normal children. Age was negatively associated with Bayley III gross motor (r = -0.44; p = .02) but not with fine motor, cognitive, or language scores. HFMSE (n = 23) showed a mean score of 31 +/- 13.

E.",,,Drug treatment for spinal muscular atrophy type I,COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by a homozygous deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene on chromosome 5, or a heterozygous deletion in combination with a point mutation in the second SMN1 allele. This results in degeneration of anterior horn cells, which leadsto progressive muscle weakness. By definition, children with SMA type I are never able to sit without support and usually die or become ventilator dependent before the age of two years. There have until very recently been no drug treatments to influence the course of SMA. We undertook this updated review to evaluate new evidence on emerging treatments for SMA type I. The review was first published in 2009 and previously updated in 2011. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of any drug therapy designed to slow or arrest progression of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type I. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and ISI Web of Science conference proceedings in October 2018. We also searched two trials registries to identify unpublished trials (October 2018). Selection criteria We sought all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that examined the efficacy of drug treatment for SMA type I. Included participants had to fulfil clinical criteria and have a genetically confirmed deletion or mutation of the SMN1 gene (5q11.2-13.2). The primary outcome measure was age at death or full-time ventilation. Secondary outcome measures were acquisition of motor milestones, i.e. head control, rolling, sitting or standing, motor milestone response on disability scores within one year after the onset of treatment, and adverse events and serious adverse events attributable to treatment during the trial period. Treatment strategies involving SMN1 gene replacement with viral vectors are out of the scope of this review. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methodology. Main results We identified two RCTs: one trial of intrathecal nusinersen in comparison to a sham (control) procedure in 121 randomised infants with SMA type I, which was newly included at this update, and one small trial comparing riluzole treatment to placebo in 10 children with SMA type I. The RCT of intrathecally-injected nusinersen was stopped early for efficacy (based on a predefined Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination-Section 2 (HINE-2) response). At the interim analyses after 183 days of treatment, 41% (21/51) of nusinersen-treated infants showed a predefined improvement on HINE-2, compared to 0% (0/27) of participants in the control group. This trial was largely at low risk of bias. Final analyses (ranging from 6 months to 13 months of treatment), showed that fewer participants died or required full-time ventilation (defined as more than 16 hours daily for 21 days or more) in the nusinersen-treated group than the control group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 0.89; N = 121; a 47% lower risk; moderate-certainty evidence). A proportion of infants in the nusinersen group and none of 37 infants in the control group achieved motor milestones: 37/73 nusinersen-treated infants (51%) achieved a motor milestone response on HINE-2 (risk ratio (RR) 38.51, 95% CI 2.43 to 610.14; N = 110; moderate-certainty evidence); 16/73 achieved head control (RR 16.95, 95% CI 1.04 to 274.84; moderate-certainty evidence); 6/73 achieved independent sitting (RR 6.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 115.38; moderate-certainty evidence); 7/73 achieved rolling over (RR 7.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 131.29); and 1/73 achieved standing (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 36.92; moderate-certainty evidence). Seventy-one per cent of nusinersen-treated infants versus 3% of infants in the control group were responders on the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) measure of motor disability (RR 26.36, 95% CI 3.79 to 183.18; N = 110; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse events and serious adverse events occurred in the majority of infants but were no more frequent in the nusinersen-treated group than the control group (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.05 and RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.89, respectively; N = 121; moderate-certainty evidence). In the riluzole trial, three of seven children treated with riluzole were still alive at the ages of 30, 48, and 64 months, whereas all three children in the placebo group died. None of the children in the riluzole or placebo group developed the ability to sit, which was the only milestone reported. There were no adverse effects. The certainty of the evidence for all measured outcomes from this study was very low, because the study was too small to detect or rule out an effect, and had serious limitations, including baseline differences. This trial was stopped prematurely because the pharmaceutical company withdrew funding. Various trials and studies investigating treatment strategies other than nusinersen, such as SMN2 augmentation by small molecules, are ongoing. Authors' conclusions Based on the very limited evidence currently available regarding drug treatments for SMA type 1, intrathecal nusinersen probably prolongs ventilation-free and overall survival in infants with SMA type I. It is also probable that a greater proportion of infants treated with nusinersen than with a sham procedure achieve motor milestones and can be classed as responders to treatment on clinical assessments (HINE-2 and CHOP INTEND). The proportion of children experiencing adverse events and serious adverse events on nusinersen is no higher with nusinersen treatment than with a sham procedure, based on evidence of moderate certainty. It is uncertain whether riluzole has any effect in patients with SMA type I, based on the limited available evidence. Future trials could provide more high-certainty, longer-term evidence to confirm this result, or focus on comparing new treatments to nusinersen or evaluate them as an add-on therapy to nusinersen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1469-493X,1361-6137,,,,,2019,,12,,,,,,,CD006281,10.1002/14651858.CD006281.pub5,0,,,,,,,,31825542.0000,,,,,WOS:000505243400045,0.0

At age 12 months, scores for those with periventricular leukomalacia were reduced by 11.9 units. Duration of hospital stay reduced scores by 0.1 for each additional day increase in hospital.

Historically, the diagnosis has been made between age 12 and 24 months but now can be made before 6 months' corrected age. OBJECTIVES To systematically review best available evidence for early, accurate diagnosis of cerebral palsy and to summarize best available evidence about cerebral palsy-specific early intervention that should follow early diagnosis to optimize neuroplasticity and function. EVIDENCE REVIEW This study systematically searched the literature about early diagnosis of cerebral palsy in MEDLINE (1956-2016), EMBASE (1980-2016), CINAHL (1983-2016), and the Cochrane Library (1988-2016) and by hand searching. Search terms included cerebral palsy, diagnosis, detection, prediction, identification, predictive validity, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The study included systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses, criteria of diagnostic accuracy, and evidence-based clinical guidelines. Findings are reported according to the PRISMA statement, and recommendations are reported according to the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. FINDINGS Six systematic reviews and 2 evidence-based clinical guidelinesmet inclusion criteria. All included articles had high methodological Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) ratings. In infants, clinical signs and symptoms of cerebral palsy emerge and evolve before age 2 years; therefore, a combination of standardized tools should be used to predict risk in conjunction with clinical history. Before 5 months' corrected age, the most predictive tools for detecting risk are term-age magnetic resonance imaging (86%-89% sensitivity), the Prechtl Qualitative Assessment of General Movements (98% sensitivity), and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (90% sensitivity). After 5 months' corrected age, the most predictive tools for detecting risk are magnetic resonance imaging (86%-89% sensitivity) (where safe and feasible), the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (90% sensitivity), and the Developmental Assessment of Young Children (83% C index). Topography and severity of cerebral palsy are more difficult to ascertain in infancy, and magnetic resonance imaging and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination may be helpful in assisting clinical decisions. In high-income countries, 2 in 3 individuals with cerebral palsy will walk, 3 in 4 will talk, and 1 in 2 will have normal intelligence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Early diagnosis begins with a medical history and involves using neuroimaging, standardized neurological, and standardized motor assessments that indicate congruent abnormal findings indicative of cerebral palsy. Clinicians should understand the importance of prompt referral to diagnostic-specific early intervention to optimize infant motor and cognitive plasticity, prevent secondary complications, and enhance caregiver well-being.",,,,,"Guzzetta, Andrea/F-1503-2010; Romeo, Domenico/AFM-6244-2022; Fahey, Michael C/B-2668-2014; Hadders-Algra, Mijna/AAM-9180-2021; Boyd, Roslyn N/A-4498-2011; de Vries, Linda S/AAB-6454-2021; fiori, simona/K-7515-2016; valentine, jane P/B-5875-2017; Forssberg, Hans/A-2944-2009; Romeo, Domenico M/K-7957-2016; Einspieler, Christa/HHS-6481-2022; Novak, Iona E/B-3061-2014; Cioni, Giovanni/A-4178-2015; McIntyre, Sarah/A-3191-2014","Guzzetta, Andrea/0000-0003-3868-0059; Fahey, Michael C/0000-0003-0811-4785; Boyd, Roslyn N/0000-0002-4919-5975; fiori, simona/0000-0002-0933-6120; Romeo, Domenico M/0000-0002-6229-1208; Novak, Iona E/0000-0001-6001-4867; Cioni, Giovanni/0000-0002-6526-5566; Morgan, Catherine/0000-0003-3670-0845; Noritz, Garey/0000-0001-7308-3810; McIntyre, Sarah/0000-0002-0234-1541; Hadders-Algra, Mijna/0000-0001-6845-5114; Maitre, Nathalie/0000-0001-8520-9302; Gordon, Andrew/0000-0003-1041-0479; valentine, jane/0000-0003-1854-7381; Pennington, Lindsay/0000-0002-4540-2586; Krumlinde-Sundholm, Lena/0000-0002-1758-0190; Karlsson, Petra/0000-0002-6253-9488; Forssberg, Hans/0000-0003-2069-6618; White, Robert/0000-0001-8782-9791; Loughran-Fowlds, Alison/0000-0001-8457-2767; Harbourne, Regina/0000-0001-8099-4145",,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-6203,2168-6211,,,,SEP,2017,171.0,9,,,,,897,907,,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.1689,0,,,,,,,,28715518.0000,,,,,WOS:000410140700018,0.0

Nusinersen has been covered by public healthcare in France since May 2017. The aim of this article is to report results after 1 year of treatment with intrathecal nusinersen in children with SMA types 1 and 2 in France. Comparisons between treatment onset (T0) and after 1 year of treatment (Y1) were made in terms of motor function and need for nutritional and ventilatory support. Motor development milestone achievements were evaluated using the modified Hammersmith Infant Neurologic Examination-Part 2 (HINE-2) for patients under 2 years of age and Motor Function Measure (MFM) scores for patients over 2 years of age. Results Data on 204 SMA patients (type 1 or 2) were retrospectively collected from the 23 French centers for neuromuscular diseases. One hundred and twenty three patients had been treated for at least 1 year and were included, 34 of whom were classified as type 1 (10 as type 1a/b and 24 as type 1c) and 89 as type 2.Survival motor Neuron 2(SMN2)copy numbers were available for all but 6 patients. Patients under 2 years of age (n = 30), had significantly higher HINE-2 scores at year 1 than at treatment onset but used more nutritional and ventilatory support. The 68 patients over 2 years of age evaluated with the Motor Function Measure test had significantly higher overall scores after 1 year, indicating that their motor function had improved. The scores were higher in the axial and proximal motor function (D2) and distal motor function (D3) parts of the MFM scale, but there was no significant difference for standing and transfer scores (D1). No child in either of the two groups achieved walking. Conclusion Nusinersen offers life-changing benefits for children with SMA, particularly those with more severe forms of the disorder. Caregiver assessments are positive. Nevertheless, patients remain severely disabled and still require intensive support care.

Data were gathered through a retrospective chart review of older spinal muscular atrophy patients (ages 5-58) being treated at Rady Children's Hospital and the University of California, San Diego with nusinersen from April 2017-June 2019. Linear mixed effects analyses found that, for older children and adult patients with SMA 1, 2, and 3, motor scores as measured by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders for non-sitters improved by 6 points (p = .01) and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination-2 by 2.6% (p = .008) over the 22-month study period. Over the same period, sitters improved on the Revised Upper Limb Module by 4.4 points (p = .02) and on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded by 3.3% (p = .00005) post treatment with nusinersen. Older spinal muscular atrophy patients (5-58 years) being treated with nusinersen at our institutions are improving. Not only have symptoms stabilized, but their motor function has shown incremental improvements. Based on the results of this study, we suggested that nusinersen is well-tolerated and efficacious when treating older children and adult patients with spinal muscular atrophy 1, and 3.

The first objective of this study was to determine the incidence of HINE. The second objective was to identify factors influencing the presence or absence of HINE symptoms in hospice patients. Methods: This was a noninterventional, prospective study. This study population included hospice patients 18 years of age or older who were admitted to one of two Nathan Adelson Hospice inpatient units in Las Vegas, Nevada, and were initiated on a scheduled regimen of hydromorphone. A total of 156 patients were enrolled and analyzed in this study. Data collection was performed by the study investigators using a standard data tracking form, including hospice diagnosis, gender, renal function, hydromorphone regimen, and whether or not the patient experienced neuroexcitatory symptoms. Data collection occurred from November 2010 to March 2011. Results and Conclusions: Based on the data collected in this study, it appears that the likelihood of HINE does increase with larger doses, increasing age, increasing serum creatinine, and the presence of malignant neoplasm. However, after adjusting for the variables in the logistic regression model, diagnosis of malignant neoplasm was not a significant predictor of HINE. Future studies may focus on evaluating metabolite levels, such as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide (H3G), in patients developing HINE symptoms. This may help to determine if the metabolites of opioids, such as H3G, are involved in the development of the neurotoxic symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1096-6218,1557-7740,,,,OCT 1,2013,16.0,10,,,,,1205,1209,,10.1089/jpm.2012.0467,0,,,,,,,,23930920.0000,,,,,WOS:000325265800012,0.0

The infants were examined between 9 and 18 months' chronologic age (6-15 months' corrected age) and scored with the optimality score system previously standardized in a cohort of low-risk term infants. The aim of the study was to establish the frequency distribution of the optimality scores in this cohort and to establish whether the scores can predict locomotor function at 2 years of age. Results: The results showed that this standardized neurologic examination can be performed in preterm infants as early as 9 months' chronologic age to predict motor outcome at 2 years old. The scores showed no significant association with the degree of prematurity or the age of assessment.

The brain's high rate of developmental activity in the early years post-term challenges early detection. It also offers opportunities for early intervention and facilitation of school readiness. The paper proposes that in the first year post-term two early detection options are feasible for LMICs: (a) caregiver screening questionnaires that carry little costs but predict neurodevelopmental disorders only moderately well; (b) the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination and Standardized Infant NeuroDevelopmental Assessment (SINDA) which are easy tools that predict neurodisability well but require assessment by health professionals. The young brain's neuroplasticity offers great opportunities for early intervention. Ample evidence indicates that families play a critical role in early intervention of infants at increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Other interventional key elements are responsive parenting and stimulation of infant development. The intervention's composition and delivery mode depend on the infant's risk profile. For instance, in infants with moderately increased risk (e.g., preterm infants) lay community health workers may provide major parts of intervention, whereas in children with neurodisability (e.g., cerebral palsy) health professionals play a larger role.",,,,,,"Hadders-Algra, Mijna/0000-0001-6845-5114",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-2360,,,,,OCT 21,2022,10.0,,,,,,,,989518,10.3389/fped.2022.989518,0,,,,,,,,36340733.0000,,,,,WOS:000879503100001,0.0

Although there is few promising treatment for SMA, but the field of translational research is active in it, and stem cell-based therapy clinical trials or case studies are ongoing. Combination of different therapeutic approaches for noncurative treatments may increase their effectiveness and compliance of patients. We present a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with SMA1 who received side population adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (SPADMSCs). Methods The intervention group received three intrathecal administrations of escalating doses of SPADMSCs and followed until 24 months or the survival time. The safety analysis was assessed by controlling the side effects and efficacy evaluations performed by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE), Ballard score, and electrodiagnostic (EDX) evaluation. These evaluations were performed before intervention and at the end of the follow-up. Results The treatment was safe and well tolerated, without any adverse event related to the stem cell administration. One of the patients in the intervention group was alive after 24 months of study follow-up. He is a non-sitter 62-month-old boy with appropriate weight gain and need for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for about 8 h per day. Clinical scores, need for supportive ventilation, and number of hospitalizations were not meaningful parameters in the response of patients in the intervention and control groups. All five patients in the intervention group showed significant improvement in the motor amplitude response of the tibial nerve (0.56mV; p: 0.029). Conclusion This study showed that SPADMSCs therapy is tolerable and safe with promising efficacy in SMA I. Probably same as other treatment strategies, early intervention will increase its efficacy and prepare time for more injections.

Its main recommendation was to concentrate care into the hands of site-specialist, multi-disciplinary teams. This study aimed to determine if the implementation of Calman - Hine cancer teams was associated with improved processes and outcomes of care for colorectal cancer patients. The design included longitudinal survey of 13 colorectal cancer teams in Yorkshire and retrospective study of population-based data collected by the Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry and Information Service. The population was all colorectal cancer patients diagnosed and treated in Yorkshire between 1995 and 2000. The main outcome measures were: variations in the use of anterior resection and preoperative radiotherapy in rectal cancer, chemotherapy in Dukes stage C and D patients, and five-year survival. Using multilevel models, these outcomes were assessed in relation to measures of the extent of Calman - Hine implementation throughout the study period, namely: (i) each team's degree of adherence to the Manual of Cancer Service Standards ( which outlines the specification of the 'ideal' colorectal cancer team) and (ii) the extent of site specialisation of each team's surgeons. Variation was observed in the extent to which the colorectal cancer teams in Yorkshire had conformed to the Calman - Hine recommendations. An increase in surgical site specialisation was associated with increased use of preoperative radiotherapy (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.04-1.98, Po0.04) and anterior resection ( OR 1.43, 95% CI = 1.16-1.76, P < 0.01) in rectal cancer patients. Increases in adherence to the Manual of Cancer Service Standards was associated with improved five-year survival after adjustment for the casemix factors of age, stage of disease, socioeconomic status and year of diagnosis, especially for colon cancer (HR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.94 - 0.99 P < 0.01). There was a similar trend of improved survival in relation to increased surgical site specialisation for rectal cancer, although the effect was not statistically significant (HR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.84 - 1.03, P = 0.15). In conclusion, the extent of implementation of the Calman - Hine report has been variable and its recommendations are associated with improvements in processes and outcomes of care for colorectal cancer patients.",,,,,"Gilthorpe, Mark S/C-1240-2008","Gilthorpe, Mark S/0000-0001-8783-7695",,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-0920,1532-1827,,,,OCT 23,2006,95.0,8,,,,,979,985,,10.1038/sj.bjc.6603372,0,,,,,,,,17047646.0000,,,,,WOS:000241384400006,0.0

Small for gestational age status confers additional risk. Aim-To determine the body water content of appropriately grown (AGA) and small for gestational age (SGA) preterm infants in order to provide a baseline for longitudinal studies of growth after preterm birth. Methods-All infants born at the Hammersmith and Queen Charlotte's Hospitals between 25 and 30 weeks gestational age were eligible for entry into the study. Informed parental consent was obtained as soon after delivery as possible, after which the extracellular fluid content was determined by bromide dilution and total body water by (H2O)-O-18 dilution. Results-Forty two preterm infants were studied. SGA infants had a significantly higher body water content than AGA infants (906 (833-954) and 844 (637-958) ml/kg respectively; median (range); p = 0.019). There were no differences in extracellular and intracellular fluid volumes, nor in the ratio of extracellular to intracellular fluid. Estimates of relative adiposity suggest a body fat content of about 7% in AGA infants, assuming negligible fat content in SGA infants and lean body tissue hydration to be equivalent in the two groups. Conclusions-Novel values for the body water composition of the SGA preterm infant at 25-30 weeks gestation are presented. The data do not support the view that SGA infants have extracellular dehydration, nor is their regulation of body water impaired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1359-2998,1468-2052,,,,JUL,2000,83.0,1,,,,,F56,F59,,10.1136/fn.83.1.F56,0,,,,,,,,10873174.0000,,,,,WOS:000088078400013,0.0

Nusinersen is specifically designed to alter splicing of SMN2 pre-mRNA and thus increase the amount of functional survival motor neuron (SMN) protein that is deficient in patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Methods This open-label, phase 2, escalating dose clinical study assessed the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy of multiple intrathecal doses of nusinersen (6 mg and 12 mg dose equivalents) in patients with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy. Eligible participants were of either gender aged between 3 weeks and 7 months old with onset of spinal muscular atrophy symptoms between 3 weeks and 6 months, who had SMN1 homozygous gene deletion or mutation. Safety assessments included adverse events, physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, cerebrospinal fluid laboratory tests, and electrocardiographs. Clinical efficacy assessments included event free survival, and change from baseline of two assessments of motor function: the motor milestones portion of the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam-Part 2 (HINE-2) and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) motor function test, and compound motor action potentials. Autopsy tissue was analysed for target engagement, drug concentrations, and pharmacological activity. HINE-2, CHOP-INTEND, and compound motor action potential were compared between baseline and last visit using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Age at death or permanent ventilation was compared with natural history using the log-rank test. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01839656. Findings 20 participants were enrolled between May 3, 2013, and July 9, 2014, and assessed through to an interim analysis done on Jan 26, 2016. All participants experienced adverse events, with 77 serious adverse events reported in 16 participants, all considered by study investigators not related or unlikely related to the study drug. In the 12 mg dose group, incremental achievements of motor milestones (p< 0 . 0001), improvements in CHOP-INTEND motor function scores (p= 0 . 0013), and increased compound muscle action potential amplitude of the ulnar nerve (p= 0 . 0103) and peroneal nerve (p< 0 . 0001), compared with baseline, were observed. Median age at death or permanent ventilation was not reached and the Kaplan-Meier survival curve diverged from a published natural history case series (p= 0 . 0014). Analysis of autopsy tissue from patients exposed to nusinersen showed drug uptake into motor neurons throughout the spinal cord and neurons and other cell types in the brainstem and other brain regions, exposure at therapeutic concentrations, and increased SMN2 mRNA exon 7 inclusion and SMN protein concentrations in the spinal cord. Interpretation Administration of multiple intrathecal doses of nusinersen showed acceptable safety and tolerability, pharmacology consistent with its intended mechanism of action, and encouraging clinical efficacy. Results informed the design of an ongoing, sham-controlled, phase 3 clinical study of nusinersen in infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy.",,,,,,"Day, John/0000-0002-0086-9529",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-6736,1474-547X,,,,DEC 17,2016,388.0,10063,,,,,3017,3026,,10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31408-8,0,,,,,,,,27939059.0000,,,,,WOS:000390112300034,0.0

Sulfide samples from the White Church area at the northern Valu Fa Ridge have delta(34)S values averaging +3.8 parts per thousand (n = 10) for bulk sphalerite-chalcopyrite mineralization and +4.8 parts per thousand for pyrite (It = IO). Barite associated with the massive sulfides exhibits an average of +20.7 parts per thousand, (rr = 10). Massive sulfides from the active Vai Lili hydrothermal field at the central Valu Fa Ridge have much higher delta(34)S ratios averaging +8.0 parts per thousand for bulk sphalerite-chalcopyrite mineralization (n = 5), +9.3 parts per thousand for pyrite samples (n = 5), and +8.0 parts per thousand, and +10.9 parts per thousand for a chalcopyrite and a sphalerite separate, respectively. The isotopic composition of barite from the Vai Lili field is similar to that of barite from the White Church area and averages +21.0 parts per thousand (n = 8). Sulfide and barite samples from the Hine Hina area at the southern Valu Fa Ridge have delta(34)S values that are considerably lighter than those observed for samples from the other areas and average -4.9 parts per thousand, for pyrite (n = 9), -4.0 and -5.7 parts per thousand for two samples of sphalerite-chalcopyrite intergrowth, and -3.4 parts per thousand, for a single chalcopyrite separate. The total spread in the isotopic composition of sulfides from Vai Lili and Hine Hina is more than 20 parts per thousand over a distance of less than 30 km. The delta(34)S values of sulfides at Hine Hina are the lowest values so far reported for volcanic-hosted polymetallic massive sulfides from the modem seafloor. Barite from the Hine Hina field also has unusually light sulfur with delta(34)S values of +16.1 to +16.7 parts per thousand, (n = 5). Isotopic compositions of the sulfides at Hine Hina indicate a dramatic decrease in delta(34)S from ordinary magmatic values and. in the absence of biogenic sulfur and/or boiling. imply a unique S-34-depleted source of probable magmatic origin. Sulfide-barite mineralization in the Hine Hina area is associated with a distinctive alteration assemblage consisting of cristobalite, pyrophyllite, kaolinite, opal-CT, talc. pyrite, native sulfur, and alunite. Similar styles of alteration are typically known from high-sulfidation epithermal systems on land. Alunite-bearing, advanced argillic alteration in the Hine Hina field confirms the role of acidic. volatile-rich fluids, and a delta(34)S value of +10.4 parts per thousand for the sulfur in the alunite is consistent with established kinetic isotope effects which accompany the disproportionation of magmatic SO2 into H2S and H2SO4. The Hine Hina field occurs near the propagating tip of the Valu Fa back-are spreading center (i.e., dominated by dike injections and seafloor eruptions) and therefore may have experienced the largest contribution of magmatic volatiles of the three fields. The sulfur isotopic ratios of the hydrothermal precipitates and the presence of a distinctive epithermal-like argillic alteration in the Hine Hina field suggest a direct contribution of magmatic vapor to the hydrothermal system and support the concept that magmatic volatiles may be an important component of some volcanogenic massive sulfide-forming hydrothermal systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0026-4598,,,,,MAR,1998,33.0,3,,,,,226,237,,10.1007/s001260050143,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000073026300002,0.0

Despite the wealth of knowledge about satDNAs, little is known about a fraction of short, satDNA-like arrays dispersed throughout the genome. Our survey of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas sequenced genome revealed genome assembly replete with satDNA-like tandem repeats. We focused on the most abundant arrays, grouped according to sequence similarity into 13 clusters, and explored their flanking sequences. Structural analysis showed that arrays of all 13 clusters represent central repeats of 11 non-autonomous elements named Cg_HINE, which are classified into the Helentron superfamily of DNA transposons. Each of the described elements is formed by a unique combination of flanking sequences and satDNA-like central repeats, coming from one, exceptionally two clusters in a consecutive order. While some of the detected Cg_HINE elements are related according to sequence similarities in flanking and repetitive modules, others evidently arose in independent events. In addition, some of the Cg_HINE's central repeats are related to the classical C. gigas satDNA, interconnecting mobile elements and satDNAs.

However, ventricular dilatation with additional brain pathology was significantly associated with CP, MDI score below 70, and NDI. A ventricular-brain ratio above 0.35 was a sensitive measure of developmental impairment. Interpretation Ventricular dilatation at term increases the risk of poor developmental outcome only when associated with other brain pathology. The ventricular-brain ratio is a useful clinical tool for determining the prognosis in VLBW and VLGA infants.",,,,,"Stolt, Suvi/V-5060-2018; Lapinleimu, Helena/AAT-8415-2021; Parkkola, Riitta/AAZ-1341-2020; Haataja, Leena/GPG-3986-2022; Haataja, Leena/G-1160-2016; Munck, Petriina/AAF-6418-2020","Stolt, Suvi/0000-0002-6029-5459; Haataja, Leena/0000-0002-8057-6194; Lehtonen, Liisa/0000-0001-8925-2594; Munck, Petriina/0000-0002-3226-8170",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-1622,1469-8749,,,,JAN,2011,53.0,1,,,,,48,54,,10.1111/j.1469-8749.2010.03785.x,0,,,,,,,,21039438.0000,,,,,WOS:000284891900013,0.0

We examined whether the developitiental aberrations associated with prenatal AED exposure-could be-detected already in infancy and whether effects on visual attention can be observed at this early age. Material and methods: We compared a prospective cohort of infants with in utero exposure to AED (n = 56) with infants without drug exposures (n = 62). The assessments performed at the age of seven months included standardized neurodevelopmental scores (Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale and Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination) as well as a novel eye-tracking-based test for visual attention and orienting to faces. Background information included prospective collection of AED exposure data, pregnancy outcome, neuropsychological evaluation of the mothers, and information on maternal epilepsy type. Results: Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and valproate, but not lamotrigine or levetiracetam, were associated with impaired early language abilities at the age of seven months. The general speed of visuospatial orienting or attentional bias for faces measured by eye-tracker-based tests did not differ between AED-exposed and control infants. Discussion: Our findings support the idea that prenatal AED exposure may impair verbal abilities, and this effect may be detected already in infancy. In contrast, the early development of attention to faces was spared after in utero AED exposure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

One of its key recommendations was to concentrate cancer care in the hands of site-specialist doctors. This retrospective population-based study aimed to determine whether this recommendation has been implemented across the Yorkshire region of the UK (population 3.6 million) for breast and colorectal cancer surgery. Information on all breast and colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2000 within the former Yorkshire Regional Health Authority of the UK was obtained from the Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry and Information Service. The annual median workloads of each surgeon operating on these patients, in terms of breast and/or colorectal cancer, were calculated. Each surgeon was categorized as either specialist or non-specialist based on his or her self-stated interests or workload. The proportion of breast and colorectal patients in each Trust and in each year receiving surgery from a site specialist was calculated to determine the extent of surgical site specialization. The distribution of surgeons' workloads in breast and colorectal cancer surgery was also examined across three time periods; 1990-93, 1994-97 and 1998-2000. There has been a major shift towards surgical site specialization in breast and colorectal cancer care across Yorkshire. The effect was more marked in breast cancer than in colorectal cancer. The degree of surgical site specialization varied considerably across hospital Trusts. In both cancer sites, the move towards surgical site specialization began prior to the publication of the Calman-Hine report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0961-5423,,,,,MAR,2007,16.0,2,,,,,150,155,,10.1111/j.1365-2354.2006.00723.x,0,,,,,,,,17371424.0000,,,,,WOS:000244942500007,0.0

Methods A total of 258 VLBW infants were born at Turku University Hospital between 2001 and 2006. Of these, 99 had undergone, within 1 week of delivery, antenatal Doppler assessment of blood flow in the umbilical artery (UA), fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA), descending aorta (DAo), aortic isthmus and ductus venosus and were eligible for inclusion in the study. Postnatally brain pathology was assessed by serial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging in 86 of the neonates and brain volume was measured in 80. Cognitive development was evaluated at 2 years of corrected age in 83 infants using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II. Motor development was assessed using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. Results On univariate analysis, abnormal pulsatility index (PI) in the UA and an abnormal UA-PI/MCA-PI ratio (P = 0.04 and P = 0.003, respectively) as well as increases in both the DAo-PI and in the DAo-PI/MCA-PI ratio (P = 0.03 and P = 0.02, respectively), were associated with adverse cognitive outcome at 2 years of age. However, when controlling for cerebral volume using multivariate analysis, the association between abnormal antenatal Doppler characteristics and cognitive outcome became statistically non-significant, which indicated the determinant role of the volume reduction. Motor development was not associated with antenatal Doppler indices. Conclusion Abnormal antenatal Doppler indices are associated with adverse cognitive outcome at 2 years in VLBW infants. Our findings suggest that this association may be mediated through brain volume. Copyright (C) 2010 ISUOG.

Up to 1 m relative sea-level rise is estimated for The Bahamas by 2100 CE, which could enhance flooding from weaker storms (<Category 3) in low-lying coastal areas. Problematically, Bahamian hurricane activity is highly spatially-heterogenous over the last 170 years, meaning that long-term regional hurricane frequency remains poorly constrained, especially for weaker Category 1-2 events that are less-likely to be detected by most sediment-based paleo-hurricane reconstructions. We present a 530-year record of hurricane passage from Hine's Blue Hole on Cay Sal Bank, The Bahamas. Hine's Hole has an accumulation rate of 2-3.2 cm/yr, making it among the highest-resolution hurricane reconstructions to date. Unlike many paleo-hurricane reconstruction sites, Hine's Hole is not surrounded by coastal landmasses that can dampen currents and waves produced by hurricanes, so it archives most >= Category 1 hurricanes passing within 115 km during the 170-year instrumental record (1850 CE-present) and may also document intense tropical or winter storms. Hine's Hole archives similar to 16 intense storms per century from 1850 to 2016 CE, but documents three periods from 1505 to 1530 CE, 1570 to 1620 CE, and similar to 1710 to 1875 CE with over twice as many intense storms per century. These active periods correspond to other high-resolution reconstructions from the Bahamian Archipelago and Florida Keys, but the magnitude of the increase is much higher given that Hine's Hole archives evidence of weaker and more distal storms. As such, this reconstruction provides unprecedented insight into changes in hurricane activity within the pre-industrial climate system and demonstrates that recurrence intervals based on the 170-year instrumental record can severely underestimate the threat hurricanes pose certain localities.",,,,,"van Hengstum, Pete/AHC-5291-2022; Sullivan, Richard/Z-6039-2019","Sullivan, Richard/0000-0002-7419-1159; Wallace, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6492-2077",,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3227,1872-6151,,,,JAN,2022,443.0,,,,,,,,106653,10.1016/j.margeo.2021.106653,0,,OCT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000710998700002,0.0

Its main recommendation was to concentrate care into the hands of site-specialist multidisciplinary teams. This study aimed to determine whether these teams improved processes and outcomes of care for breast cancer patients. Patients and methods: All patients diagnosed and treated with breast cancer in the Yorkshire region of the UK from 1995 to 2000 were identified within the Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry and Information Service database. Changes in the use of breast-conserving surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery and 5-year survival were assessed among these patients in relation to their managing breast cancer team's degree of adherence to the manual of cancer service standards (which outlines the specification of the 'ideal' breast cancer team) and the extent of site specialisation of each team's surgeons. Results: Variation was observed in the extent to which the breast cancer teams in Yorkshire had conformed to the Calman-Hine recommendations. Increases in adherence to the recommendations in the manual of cancer service standards were associated with a reduction in the use of breast-conserving surgery [odds ratio (OR) = 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.70-0.98, P < 0.01]. Increases in both surgical specialisation (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.00-1.55, P = 0.06) and adherence to the manual of cancer service standards (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.97-1.52, P = 0.05) were associated with the increased use of radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery. There was a trend towards improved 5-year survival (hazard ratio = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.86-1.01, P = 0.10) in relation to increasing surgical site specialisation. All these effects were present after adjustment for the casemix factors of age, stage of disease, socio-economic background and year of diagnosis.

A retrospective study approach was used implementing uniform definitions for colon, rectal, breast, melanoma, bladder and ovarian cancers. A total of 14 527 cases registered by the East Anglian cancer registry and diagnosed between 1989 and 1993 were included. The cases were analysed in two age groups (< 75, 75+ years) and two hospital groups: group 1, those treated at hospitals with radiotherapy and oncology departments; group 2, other district general hospitals. Adjusted hazard ratios derived from Cox's proportional hazards model and adjusted conditional survival curves were presented. We found that after adjustment for age, sex and tumour stage at diagnosis, survival up to 5 years after diagnosis was usually worse in group 2 hospitals and significantly so for patients aged < 75 years with breast, ovarian and rectal tumours. Hospital workload produced little significant effect independently from hospital group. Analysing the selected cancer sites using uniform definitions and consistent staging supports the view that the strategy proposed in the Calman-Hine report is likely to be beneficial, hut particular priority for change should be given to younger patients with breast, ovarian and rectal rumours.

We aim to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a group participatory EIP, the 'ABAaNA EIP', for young children with neurodevelopmental impairment in Uganda. Methods and analysis We will conduct a pilot feasibility, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial comparing the EIP with standard care across two study sites (one urban, one rural) in central Uganda. Eligible infants (n=126, age 6-11 completed months) with neurodevelopmental impairment (defined as a developmental quotient <70 on Griffiths Scales of Mental Development, and, or Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination score <60) will be recruited and randomised to the intervention or standard care arm. Intervention arm families will receive the 10-modular, peer-facilitated, participatory, community-based programme over 6 months. Recruited families will be followed up at 6 and 12 months after recruitment, and assessors will be blinded to the trial allocation. The primary hypothesis is that the ABAaNA EIP is feasible and acceptable when compared with standard care. Primary outcomes of interest are feasibility (number recruited and randomised at baseline) and acceptability (protocol violation of arm allocation and number of sessions attended) and family and child quality of life. Guided by the study aim, the qualitative data analysis will use a data-led thematic framework approach. The findings will inform scalability and sustainability of the programme.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate muscle strength, Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (Expanded) score and the patterns of muscle weakness in relation to age and SMA type. ResultsWe included 180 patients with SMA types 1-4 in the age range 1-77.5years with median disease duration of 18 (range 0-65.8)years. With the exception of the early phases of disease in which children with SMA types 2 and 3 may achieve new motor skills and show a temporary increase in muscle strength, cross-sectional data suggested that declining muscle strength and loss of motor skills over time are characteristic of all SMA types. Mean loss of strength was at least 1 point on the Medical Research Council score and 0.5 point on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (Expanded) score per year. Trend lines compatible with deterioration of motor function and muscle strength started in childhood and continued into adulthood. The age at loss of specific motor skills was associated with disease severity. Triceps, deltoid, iliopsoas and quadriceps were the weakest muscles in all patients.

National guidance from the National Health Service (NHS) Executive in 2001 stated that specialist oesophagogastric cancer centres should 'aim to draw patients from catchme it areas with a population of 1-2million.' For pancreatic cancers, the catchment areas should be between 2 and 4 million, reflecting the relatively lower incidence of disease. For the West Midlands region, these recommendations would suggest that four or five centres might be required to provide specialist surgical management for oesophagogastric cancer, and one or two centres for pancreatic disease. We used Hospital Episode Statistics to analyse trends in management patterns for these tumours within the West Midlands during the period 1992-2000. Over 20 different units were involved in the management of oesophagogastric and pancreatic disease, and we were unable to discern any clear and consistent move towards the centralisation of the upper gastrointestinal work in high-volume units since the publication of the Calman-Hine report in 1995. Although the drive for centralisation might be anticipated to increase following the publication of the NHS Executive's guidance, there is a substantial way to go before the provision of surgical services for upper gastrointestinal cancers is limited to a small number of high-volume specialist units.

However, most user network embedding models utilize homogeneous properties to represent users, such as attributes or user network structure. Though some works try to combine two kinds of properties, the existing works are still not enough to leverage the rich semantics of users. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous information preserving user network embedding model, which is named HINE, for user behavior classification in user network. HINE applies attributes, user network connection, user network structure, and user behavior label information for user representation in user network embedding. The embedded vectors considering these multi-type properties of users contribute to better user behavior classification performances. Experiments verified the superior performances of the proposed approach on real-world complex user network dataset. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide drug that modifies pre-messenger RNA splicing of the SMN2 gene and thus promotes increased production of full-length SMN protein.& para;& para;METHODS & para;& para;We conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, phase 3 efficacy and safety trial of nusinersen in infants with spinal muscular atrophy. The primary end points were a motor-milestone response (defined according to results on the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination) and event-free survival (time to death or the use of permanent assisted ventilation). Secondary end points included over all survival and subgroup analyses of event-free survival according to disease duration at screening. Only the first primary end point was tested in a prespecified interim analysis. To control the overall type I error rate at 0.05, a hierarchical testing strategy was used for the second primary end point and the secondary end points in the final analysis.& para;& para;RESULTS & para;& para;In the interim analysis, a significantly higher percentage of infants in the nusinersen group than in the control group had a motor-milestone response (21 of 51 infants [41 %] vs. 0 of 27 [0%], P<0.001), and this result prompted early termination of the trial. In the final analysis, a significantly higher percentage of infants in the nusinersen group than in the control group had a motor-milestone response (37 of 73 infants [51%] vs. 0 of 37 [0%]), and the likelihood of event-free survival was higher in the nusinersen group than in the control group (hazard ratio for death or the use of permanent assisted ventilation, 0.53; P=0.005). The likelihood of overall survival was higher in the nusinersen group than in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.37; P=0.004), and infants with a shorter disease duration at screening were more likely than those with a longer disease duration to benefit from nusinersen. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups.& para;& para;CONCLUSIONS & para;& para;Among infants with spinal muscular atrophy, those who received nusinersen were more likely to be alive and have improvements in motor function than those in the control group.

The distribution of males and females may vary both temporally and spatially due to differences in the costs of reproduction and the distribution of critical resources. Conservation of a species requires knowledge of the habitat use of both sexes in order to predict the population size and protect all habitats that a species requires. Adult dragonfly populations often have highly male-biased sex ratios at the breeding habitat. This bias has been attributed to females using alternative habitats to avoid male harassment, or to high female mortality. We monitored adult Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana Williamson) populations, in breeding and non-breeding habitats in Door County, Wisconsin and found significant differences in habitat use between males and females. Males primarily used wetland habitats, while females primarily used dry meadows and marginal breeding habitats, only coming into wetlands to lay-eggs or find mates. We assessed food resources in the different habitats and found that high quality insect prey (primarily adult Diptera) were more available in the wetland habitat, indicating that these areas were likely a more productive foraging area for adult dragonflies. The fact that females appear to avoid the wetland habitat is consistent with the hypothesis that male harassment alters female distribution patterns. Consideration of the patterns of habitat use by S. hineana indicates the need to develop a broader understanding of the importance of non-wetland areas in the conservation of wetland species.

Methods We included 122 patients, of age ranging between 3 months and 22 years, 1 month. More than 70% (85/122) were older than 2 years and 25% (31/122) older than 10 years. Patients were classified according to the severity of phenotype and to the number of SMN2 copies. Results Patients with the more common and the most severe phenotype older than 2 years were, with few exceptions, on noninvasive ventilation and, with increasing age, more often had tracheostomy or >16-hour ventilation and a gastrostomy inserted. In contrast, 25 of the 28 patients with the mildest phenotype older than 2 years had no need for tracheostomy or other ventilatory or nutritional support. In patients older than 2 years, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders scores were generally lower compared to those found in younger patients and showed distinct levels of functional abilities according to the severity of the phenotype. Similar findings were also observed on the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. Conclusions Our findings confirm that, after the age of 2 years, patients with type 1 spinal muscular atrophy generally survive only if they have gastrostomy and tracheostomy or noninvasive ventilation >16 hours and have low scores on the functional scales. More variability, however, can be expected in those with the mildest phenotype, who achieve head control. These data provide important baseline information at the time treatments are becoming available.",,,,,"Bertini, Enrico/ABG-1278-2020; Coratti, Giorgia/AAV-3224-2021; Bruno, Claudio/A-3148-2015; Coratti, Giorgia/Y-6292-2019; Lucibello, Simona/AAB-6848-2022; Tiziano, Francesco Danilo/A-7260-2010; Brigati, Giorgia/AAB-1408-2020; Catteruccia, Michela/AAB-5714-2020; Bertini, Enrico/A-2284-2014; Mercuri, Eugenio/G-1351-2015; Pera, Maria Carmela/J-6068-2018","Coratti, Giorgia/0000-0001-6666-5628; Bruno, Claudio/0000-0002-3426-2901; Coratti, Giorgia/0000-0001-6666-5628; Lucibello, Simona/0000-0003-0970-5755; Tiziano, Francesco Danilo/0000-0002-5545-6158; Pirola, Alice/0000-0002-0788-895X; Pedemonte, Marina/0000-0001-8410-6918; Bertini, Enrico/0000-0001-9276-4590; Brigati, Giorgia/0000-0002-8040-5950; Mercuri, Eugenio/0000-0002-9851-5365; Pane, Marika/0000-0002-4851-6124; Pera, Maria Carmela/0000-0001-6777-1721; ALBAMONTE, EMILIO/0000-0002-8465-4460",,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-3878,1526-632X,,,,AUG 21,2018,91.0,8,,,,,E696,E703,,10.1212/WNL.0000000000006050,0,,,,,,,,30045959.0000,,,,,WOS:000442272400001,0.0

The HED relies on groundwater discharge areas to complete its life cycle and therefore the population is potentially sensitive to changes in groundwater. The goals of this study were to, (1) characterize groundwater discharge to the eastern portion of the Minesing Wetlands, which corresponds to the HED habitat, (2) document any significant changes in groundwater chemistry since a 1998 study, and (3) establish a comprehensive baseline water quality data set to facilitate future comparisons. Consistent with HED habitats in the USA, the chemistry of Minesing Wetlands groundwater was dominated by calcium and bicarbonate. Low groundwater chloride and nitrate concentrations indicated minimal impact from activities such as road salt application and fertilizer use. Nitrate was generally only found at the wetland margin where groundwater springs emerged from the base of the uplands. The dominant form of inorganic nitrogen in wetland groundwater was ammonium (max = 1.5 mg N/L), and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations were also relatively high (8 to 122 mu g/L). The most consistent change in wetland groundwater chemistry between the 1998 study and samples collected in 2015-2017 was that chloride concentrations in 10 of 23 wells increased over time, however the maximum mean well chloride (11.6 mg/L) remained well below the guideline for the protection of aquatic life (120 mg/L). To preserve HED habitat, potential impacts to groundwater need to be considered during land use planning for the recharge area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0923-4861,1572-9834,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11273-023-09918-3,0,,MAR 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000950012100001,0.0

It advocated a change from a generalist model (eg, care given by general surgeons and physicians) that was supported by specialists to a fully specialist service. The process of policy development was innovative and the report was accepted widely throughout the UK. However, implementation, which began at a time of organisational change across the UK National Health Service (NHS), was not addressed sufficiently in the years immediately after publication. Consequently, change was more variable both geographically and within a single location and took longer than necessary. Evidence from research, routine data, and external assessments suggest that the policy was eventually successful and a worthwhile change.

We investigated whether maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), obesity, and diet could affect the neurodevelopment of 2-year-old children. Methods: Neurodevelopment of children (n = 243) born to mothers with overweight or obesity was assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition, and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. Maternal adiposity was determined by air displacement plethysmography, and GDM with an oral glucose tolerance test. Dietary assessment included diet quality and fish consumption questionnaires, and three-day food diaries, from which dietary inflammatory index (DII (R)) scores were computed. Results: GDM was associated with weaker expressive language skills (adj.beta = -1.12, 95% CI = -2.10;-0.15), and higher maternal adiposity with weaker cognitive, language, and motor skills in children (adj.p < 0.05). Maternal good dietary quality (adj.beta = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.004;1.73) and higher fish consumption (adj.p = 0.02) were related to better expressive language skills. DII scores were not associated with children's neurodevelopment. Conclusions: Findings suggest that GDM and higher maternal adiposity may lead to weaker neurodevelopmental skills, although still within the mean normative range in this population of children.

In 2017, international guidelines for early detection of CP were published on the basis of a systematic review of evidence. Our study aim was to reduce the age at CP diagnosis throughout a network of 5 diverse US high-risk infant follow-up programs through consistent implementation of these guidelines. METHODS: The study leveraged plan-do-study-act and Lean methodologies. The primary outcome was age at CP diagnosis. Data were acquired during the corresponding 9-month baseline and quarterly throughout study. Balancing measures were clinic no-show rates and parent perception of the diagnosis visit. Clinic teams conducted strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analyses, process flow evaluations, standardized assessments training, and parent questionnaires. Performance of a 3- to 4-month clinic visit was a critical process step because it included a Hammersmith Infant Neurologic Examination, a General Movements Assessment, and standardized assessments of motor function. RESULTS: The age at CP diagnosis decreased from a weighted average of 19.5 (95% confidence interval 16.2 to 22.8) to 9.5 months (95% confidence interval 4.5 to 14.6), with P = .008; 3- to 4-month visits per site increased from the median (interquartile range) 14 (5.2-73.7) to 54 (34.5-152.0), with P < .001; and no-show rates were not different. Parent questionnaires revealed positive provider perception with improvement opportunities for information content and understandability. CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale implementation of international guidelines for early detection of CP is feasible in diverse high-risk infant follow-up clinics. The initiative was received positively by families and without adversely affecting clinic operational flow. Additional parent support and education are necessary. Using implementation science to apply early detection guidelines across an academic network, this study lowered the age at diagnosis of CP to below 12 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-4005,1098-4275,,,,MAY,2020,145.0,5,,,,,,,e20192126,10.1542/peds.2019-2126,0,,,,,,,,32269135.0000,,,,,WOS:000531417100022,0.0

For threatened or endangered species that typically do not have large adult populations, fast reproduction rates, and/or rapid recolonization rates, such mortality is likely to have significant population consequences. Thus, exploring ways to reduce roadkill rates will have considerable conservation benefits. In this study, we evaluate whether a diversion structure can be used to modify flight behavior of the endangered Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana) in ways that would reduce roadway mortality. Flight behavior of adult S. hineana was observed with and without two 3 m high nets spaced at 6 and 12 m to simulate a small and a larger roadway. The netting significantly deterred (p < 0.0001) S. hineana adults from crossing the simulated roadway. Flight height was also influenced significantly (p = 0.0025) with flight heights over the 6 m net spacing being higher than those over the 12 m spacing. This study suggests that the use of diversion netting in areas where sensitive dragonfly species interact with motor vehicles might aid in reducing roadway mortality and might help reduce the overall impact of roadways on wetland ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1366-638X,1572-9753,,,,JUN,2015,19.0,3,,,,,449,455,,10.1007/s10841-015-9765-6,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000356161600002,0.0

This study aimed to assess whether the uptake of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer varied by hospital type in Scotland. Hospitals were classified according to cancer specialisation rather than volume of patients. To indicate cancer specialisation, hospitals were classified as 'cancer centres', 'cancer units' and 'noncancer' hospitals. Colorectal cancer cases were obtained from cancer registrations linked to hospital discharge data for the period January 1992 to December 1996. Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the binary outcome, namely whether or not a patient received chemotherapy within 6 months of first admission to any hospital. The results showed that patients admitted first to a 'non-cancer' hospital were less than half as likely to go on to receive chemotherapy as those first admitted to a cancer unit or centre (OR=0.28). This result was not explained by distance between hospital of first admission and nearest cancer centre, nor by increasing age or severity of illness. The study covers the period immediately preceding the introduction of the Calman-Hine report in Scotland and should serve as a baseline for future monitoring of access to specialist care.

Evidence of present-day hydrothermal activity at the Hine Hina site is indicated by a thermal anomaly in the overlying water column.

Entanglement constraints on the chains are approximated by sliplinks. We model the chain dynamics using a dynamic Monte Carlo scheme, with a hop acceptance criterion based on the traversal of high energy barriers. We use this to address the recent experiments of Hine et al., which investigated the effects of melt processing on stress-strain behavior. Polystyrene samples were stretched, annealed at constant length for various times, then either subjected to shrinkage tests or further stress-strain tests. Our model reproduces, at a qualitative level, the observations of Hine et al. It indicates that whilst the initial (weak) strain hardening involves deformation of chain subunits smaller than the entanglement length, the transition to stronger strain hardening involves the pulling tight of a small fraction of chain strands trapped in between entanglements. The insights gained suggest a route towards development of molecular-based constitutive models for strain hardening in the glassy state, and specifically the effect of melt processing.

One-to-One midwifery was implemented to achieve the targets set. it was the first time such a service had been implemented in the Health Service. An evaluation was undertaken to compare its performance with conventional maternity care. Methods This was a prospective comparative study of women receiving One-to-One care and women receiving the system of care that One-to-One replaced (conventional care) to compare achievement of continuity of carer and clinical outcomes. The evaluation took place in The Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, the Queen Charlotte's and Hammersmith Hospitals. This was part of a larger study, which included the evaluation of women's responses, cost implications, and clinical standards and staff reactions. The participants were all those receiving One-to-One midwifery practice (728 women), which was confined to two postal districts, and all women receiving care in the system that One-to-One replaced, in two adjacent postal districts (675 women), and expecting to give birth between 15 August 1994 and 14 August 1995. Main outcome measures were achievement of continuity of care, rates of interventions in labour, length of labour, maternal and infant morbidity, and breastfeeding rates. Results A high degree of continuity was achieved through the whole process of maternity care. One-to-One women saw fewer staff at each stage of their care, knew more of the staff who they did see, and had a high level of constant support in labour. One-to-One practice was associated with a significant reduction in the use of epidural anaesthesia (odds ratio (OR) 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) = 0.59 (0.44, 0.80)), with fewer rates of episiotomy and perineal lacerations (OR 95 per cent Cl = 0.70 (0.50, 0.98)), and with shorter second stage labour (median 40 min vs 48 min). There were no statistically significant differences in operative and assisted delivery or breastfeeding rates. Conclusions This study confirms that One-to-One midwifery practice can provide a high deg ree of continuity of carer, a nd is associated with a reduction in the rate of a number of interventions, without com promising safety of ca re. It should be extended locally and replicated in other services under continuing evaluation.",,,,,,"McCourt, Christine/0000-0003-4765-5795; Vail, Andy/0000-0001-8274-2726",,,,,,,,,,,,,0957-4832,,,,,SEP,1999,21.0,3,,,,,243,248,,10.1093/pubmed/21.3.243,0,,,,,,,,10528949.0000,,,,,WOS:000082862900002,0.0

Objective: To report the evaluation of the nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, on the motor function of SMA1. Methods: This was a longitudinal and observational study to assess the outcomes of nusinersen therapy in SMA1 patients using the HINE-2 and CHOP-INTEND scales. Results: Twenty-one SMA1 patients (52.4% males) were included; the mean age at first symptoms was 2.7 months (SD = +/- 1.5), and the mean disease duration at first dose was 34.1 (SD = +/- 36.0) months.

Many species are difficult to capture or range over large areas, making direct monitoring of populations through capture or observation extremely challenging. In such cases, indirect methods of assessing populations can be the only source of reliable information. We examined whether the discarded exoskeleton of the last larval instar (exuvia), left behind when dragonflies emerge into the adult stage, could be used to predict larval densities and provide life history information for the federally listed endangered, Hine's Emerald Dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana). Using standardized protocols, we collected exuvia within six 2 x 2 in plots in an ephemeral wetland in Door County, Wisconsin during spring and summer of 1999 and 2000. S. hineana is a summer emerger, with more than 95% of the emergence occurring from late June until mid-Juh. Based on time of emergence and the flight period, adults appear to live a month or longer. The sex ratio at emergence did not differ significantly from a 1:1 ratio and emergence was synchronous between the sexes. Estimates of larval population density using exuvial data were similar to those obtained through intensive direct sampling for larvae. Exuvial collections provide a reliable estimate of larval population density, help link larval ecology to adult ecology and are a useful tool for assessing habitat suitability. Although sampling exuviae requires repeated searching on particular sites, less expertise and fewer people are required for this type of sampling, indicating that exuvial surveys can be a very effective tool for monitoring populations of endangered dragonflies.

This study aimed to identify and specify priority physician diagnostic behaviours to target in implementation interventions to increase the rate of diagnosis of cerebral palsy under 6 months of age in Australia. Methods We conducted a two-round online Delphi study with a multi-professional expert panel of cerebral palsy researchers and clinicians. A reference group identified a six-item list of potential diagnostic behaviours, which were modifiable at the individual level, that could lead to an early cerebral palsy diagnosis. In the first survey, participants rated the importance of each item on a 10-point Likert scale and supplied their reasoning for this, and were able to suggest new behaviours. In the second survey, participants ranked items in order of priority. Results All six items reached consensus for inclusion (100%). No new items were added to the list. Ranking identified the top three priorities for online physician implementation interventions: (i) refer for or conduct the General Movements Assessment; (ii) refer for or conduct the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination; and (iii) communication of the diagnosis.

We are finally able to counter the progression of this devastating genetic disease. contributing to the definition of new trajectories in its natural history and the identification of new SMA phenotypes post-gene therapy. The aim of this paper was to use the The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health-Children and Youth as a framework for the management of spinal muscular atrophy in the era of gene therapy: a proof-of-concept study (ICF-CY) as a comprehensive documentation tool to better understand and improve care provided to a child with SMA and to illustrate its use in a multidisciplinary perspective with a proof-of-concept study. CASE REPORT: An SMA child under gene therapy receiving a rehabilitation program. Clinical and functional outcome measures assessed at all levels of the ICF-CY, including impairment by Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination, activity by Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale and Functional Independence Measure for Children, and participation by Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (TM) - FedsQL (TM) and Neuromuscular Module (TM) as well as by parent report. Treatment outcomes were assessed at two main time points: at T-0: prior to administration of nusinersen, and T-1: immediately before the first administration of maintenance doses, 6 months after the first administration of nusinersen. A significant clinical improvement was seen on all domains between T-0 and T-1. The patient improved especially in motor skills and motor disability severity. The HRQOL showed a substantial improvement, too. ICF-CY codes were used to document change in body functions or structures, performance of activities or participation in social roles both in terms of gradient and hierarchy of change. This proof-of-concept study is the first attempt to explore SMA in a comprehensive manner from the perspective of the ICF-CY using a selected set of codes. These codes define essential child dimensions that can make up an ICF-CY core set, as identified by a trained multidisciplinary team, to guide assessment. treatment and rehabilitation.

Morphometric and mineralogical analyses reveal that the iron-rich filaments are the most important constituents of these Fe-Mn-Si oxide deposits. Both the morphologies and chemical composition of the filaments indicate that neutrophilic Fe-oxidizing bacteria have played a key role in the formation of these deposits. A key process of the formation of these deposits is the creation of a complicated filamentous network in which a series of metabolic activities and passive sorption and nucleation processes occur. The precipitation of dissolved Si in unsaturated and saturated states leads to a two-generation growth model in the hydrothermal vents. The precipitation of amorphous opal occurs in a relatively narrow temperature range (41.1-42.9 degrees C) based on oxygen isotope analyses, indicating a fast precipitation rate of opal-A when conductive cooling of the hydrothermal fluid occurrs. Patchy nontronite in the Mariner fields is a product of the direct precipitation from hydrothermal fluids at a temperature of similar to 87.9 degrees C, whereas the scattered nontronite at the Hine Nina field is the product of the replacement of hydrothermal Fe-Si oxides at a temperature of similar to 46.2 degrees C.

We investigated bone metabolism, bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures, and their possible correlation with age and motor capacities. Thirty-two children with SMA (27 type 2, 5 type 3), mean age 40 +/- 32.3 months, underwent two evaluations at an 18-month interval (V1 and V2). Twelve of these children also underwent a third evaluation at month 36 (V3). Diet, bone metabolism, BMD, X-rays, and motor function (by the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded - HFMSE - and the Upper Limb Module - ULM) were assessed. At V1, 25-OH vitamin D-3 (25OH D) therapy was started, and dietary calcium intake adjusted according to the recommended dietary allowance. Low 25OH D levels and asymptomatic vertebral fractures were mainly observed at V1. At all visits, bone resorption markers were higher than normal. At V2 and V3, decreased BMD was observed. Higher spine BMD values at follow-up were associated with HFMSE score >12 at baseline (p<0.03). This study suggests that even young children with SMA are at risk of severe bone fragility. Further investigations of the molecular mechanisms leading to altered bone metabolism in SMA could help identify novel therapeutic targets and establish better guidelines for bone fragility management.

Methods Two groups were formed from among patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) followed up between September 2017 and June 2021: group 1, SMA type 1; group 2, SMA type 2 and 3. The laboratory parameters were evaluated in groups 1 and 2 between doses. Motor scale tests were performed on patients before each dose of nusinersen. Results Twenty seven patients (group 1; n = 13, group 2; n = 14) were included. The mean age (+/- standard deviation) at the onset of symptoms was 3 +/- 1.21 (range, 1.5-6) months in group 1 and 12 +/- 4.27 ( range, 8-24) months in group 2. No significant laboratory treatment-related abnormalities and adverse effects were observed. The cerebrospinal fluid protein levels and the frequency of conventional LP were higher in group 1. Serum creatinine (Cr) levels were higher in group 1 before the first dose and higher in group 2 before the fifth dose (p < 0.05). With treatment, the Cr levels of group 1 decreased and group 2 remained constant or increased. We observed that the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders and Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expand scores increased as our patients received treatment (p < 0.05). Conclusion Our results support the safety and efficacy of nusinersen. However, changes in Cr levels according to the clinical type and treatment suggested that serum Cr could be a candidate marker for treatment follow-up.",,,,,,"Gunay, Cagatay/0000-0001-7860-6297; Edem, Pinar/0000-0002-0395-7866; SARIKAYA UZAN, Gamze/0000-0002-5028-9995",,,,,,,,,,,,,0174-304X,1439-1899,,,,OCT,2022,53.0,5,,,,,321,329,,10.1055/s-0042-1750719,0,,JUL 2022,,,,,,35871521.0000,,,,,WOS:000829203300004,0.0

The HIN (Health Issue Network) approach, as Petri Nets-based formal language, is introduced as capable of providing a novel perspective to facilitate the acquisition of such competencies, graphically representing the network among a set of health issues (HIs) that affect a person throughout their life, and describing how HIs evolve over time. The need to provide a more immediate user-oriented interface has led to the development of f-HIN (friendly HIN), a lighter version based on the same mathematical properties as HIN, from which stems in turn the f-HINe (friendly HIN extracted) model, used to represent networks related to either real patients' clinical experiences extracted from electronic health records, or from teacher-designed realistic clinical histories. Such models have also been designed to be embedded in a software learning environment that allows drawing a f-HIN diagram, checking for its format correctness, as well as designing clinical exercises for the learners, including their computer-assisted assessment. The present paper aims at introducing and discussing the f-HIN/f-HINe models and their educational use. It also introduces the main features of the software learning environment it was built upon, pointing out its importance to: (i) help medical teachers in designing and representing the context of a learning outcome; and (ii) handle the complex history of a multimorbidity patient, to be conveyed in Case-Based Learning (CBL) exercises.",,,,,"tamburis, oscar/Q-1199-2018","tamburis, oscar/0000-0002-0130-7915; Consorti, Fabrizio/0000-0001-7096-4428; Pecoraro, Fabrizio/0000-0001-5718-4240",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2079-9292,,,,SEP,2021,10.0,17,,,,,,,2075,10.3390/electronics10172075,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000694124200001,0.0

Additionally, we calculate basal melt due to heat dissipation within water and ice. Data collated from published information on glacier dynamics and climate station readings show that total basal melt contributes on average similar to 2.50 m a(-1) over the lower to mid-ablation zone (300-1500 m a.s.l.), which is equivalent to >10% of the total ablation for the glacier.

Adulthood-onset SMA (SMA type 4) is rare, with few isolated cases reported. The objective of the present study was to describe a cohort of patients with SMA type 4. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to characterize clinical, genetic, radiological and neurophysiological features of patients with adulthood-onset SMA. Correlation analysis of functional assessment with genetic, radiological and neurophysiological data was performed. Results Twenty patients with SMA type 4 were identified in a Brazilian cohort of 227 patients with SMA. The most common clinical symptom was limb-girdle muscle weakness, observed in 15 patients (75%). The most frequent neurological findings were absent tendon reflexes in 18 (90%) and fasciculations in nine patients (45%). Sixteen patients (80%) had the homozygous deletion of exon 7 in the SMN1 gene, with 12 patients (60%) showing four copies of the SMN2 gene. The functional scales Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised, Revised Upper Limb Module and Spinal Muscular Atrophy Functional Rating Scale, as well as the six-minute walk and the Time Up and Go tests showed a correlation with duration of disease. Motor Unit Number Index was correlated both with duration of disease and with performance in functional assessment. Radiological studies exhibited a typical pattern, with involvement of biceps femoris short head and gluteus minimus in all patients.

We report a long-term follow-up in adolescent and adult patients with SMA types 1 and 2. Methods: Nusinersen-treated patients with SMA types 1 and 2 between 2017 and 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. We com-pared baseline motor function tests with those after the final treatment. Physical and occupational therapists performed Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND), Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE), and Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM). The Landau and Galant reflexes were not performed in CHOP-INTEND. Meaningful improvement was defined as CHOP-INTEND, 4; HFSME, 3; and RULM, 2. Results: Seven patients with SMA (type 1, 1; type 2, 6) with a median age of 23 (range, 12-40) years were treated with nusinersen for 3.55 (1.78-4.53) years. Improvement was detected in CHOP-INTEND (pre, 5 [0-31]; post, 21 [0-39]; difference, 5 [0-26]; p = 0.100) without significance, although not in HFMSE (pre, 0 [0-3]; post, 0 [0-5]; difference, 0 [0-2]; p = 0.346) and RULM (pre, 1 [0-20]; post, 3 [0-21]; difference, 1 [0-2]; p = 0.089).

Kisspeptin has emerged as a putative marker of placental function, but limited data exist describing circulating kisspeptin levels across all 3 trimesters in women with antenatal complications. Objective We aimed to assess whether kisspeptin levels are altered in women with antenatal complications. Methods Women with antenatal complications (n = 105) and those with uncomplicated pregnancies (n = 265) underwent serial ultrasound scans and blood sampling at the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit at Hammersmith Hospital, UK, at least once during each trimester (March 2014 to March 2017). The women with antenatal complications (HDP [n = 32], FGR [n = 17], GDM [n = 35], PTB [n = 11], and multiple complications [n=10]) provided 373 blood samples and the controls provided 930 samples. Differences in circulating kisspeptin levels were assessed. Results Third-trimester kisspeptin levels were higher than controls in HDP but lower in FGR. The odds of HDP adjusted for gestational age, maternal age, ethnicity, BMI, smoking, and parity were increased by 30% (95% CI, 16%-47%; P < 0.0001), and of FGR were reduced by 28% (95% CI, 4-46%; P = 0.025), for every 1 nmol/L increase in plasma kisspeptin.

If experimental measurements are unavailable values of Henry's law constants may be estimated by various methods. Several of these methods depend upon quantitative structure-property relationships. A method developed by Hine and Mookerjee depends on the assumption that each bond of a particular type makes approximately the same contribution to the molar free energy change when different organic gases are dissolved in water. The solubility of gases and also the rate at which gases dissolve in cloud droplets is important for the understanding of processes which occur in the atmosphere. A simple model for the uptake of gases by water is based on an analogy with the behaviour of an electric circuit containing resistances in series and in parallel.

Geographical access was estimated as travel time in minutes from LSOAs (Lower Super Output Areas) to the nearest hospital site and aggregated to PCT level. Correlations between PCT level mean travel times and cancer cases were estimated using Spearman's rank correlation. Associations between PCT level mean travel times and cancer relative survival rates were estimated using linear regression with adjustment for area deprivation and for a PCT level measure of the reported ease of obtaining a doctor's appointment. We found that cancer services tended to be located farther from areas with more cancer cases, and longer average travel times are associated with worse survival after adjustment for age, sex, year and area deprivation. This suggests that geographical access to cancer services remains a concern in England. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most studies in this field favor vertebrate target species. Environmental DNA protocols can be especially useful for endangered invertebrates such as the Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana) where conservation efforts have been greatly hindered by training, time, overall costs, and environmental impacts associated with conducting surveys in the calcareous fens occupied by this species. An essential step in developing such a protocol is to evaluate the dynamics of eDNA concentration under controlled conditions. We used the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to examine seasonal shifts in the persistence and net-accumulation of eDNA from captive S. hineana larvae in experimental mesocosms at temperatures corresponding with their overwintering (5.0 degrees C) and active (16.0 degrees C) seasons. Environmental DNA persisted longer at 5.0 degrees C but accumulated more readily at 16.0 degrees C. Differences in the accumulation and persistence of eDNA reflect differences in the longevity of eDNA at different temperatures and seasonal differences in larval S. hineana behavior. This study highlights the importance of considering how seasonal changes in temperature influence not only the speed of eDNA degradation but also the target species' eDNA shedding rates.",,,,,,"Schmidt, Kristie/0000-0002-5371-7131",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,SEP 23,2021,11.0,1,,,,,,,18987,10.1038/s41598-021-98099-1,0,,,,,,,,34556696.0000,,,,,WOS:000698791600094,0.0

In total, similar to 2600 strike orientations of single-layer joints (SW) and multilayer joints (MLI) mirrored four main stress fields: 1) sigma H-NW(J1.326 degrees()), 2) sigma H-NNW((J2-343)degrees()), 3) sigma HNNE(J3-033 degrees()), and 4) sigma H-N ((J4-360)degrees). The results showed that the relatively lower values of the fracture spacing ratio (FSR) and their standard deviations in J1 implied that J1 was formed during the burial stage of the Eocene chalk formations. The inconsistency between the statistical parameters of the log-normal distributions of joint spacing and FSR raised doubt about the applicability of the saturation joint density model in our studied area. The joint sets characteristics suggest that the regional sigma H-NW operated during the Eocene. During the Miocene, the regional stress field changed clockwise to sigma H-NNW, probably in association with the early stage of transform motion along the Dead Sea Fault.

The recent development of novel drugs to treat SMA has been encouraging, and nusinersen is the first drug approved to treat SMA. Objective: To explore cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of SMA and investigate their relationship with symptoms and the treatment response in pediatric patients. Methods: We analyzed the CSF levels of chitotriosidase 1 (CHIT1) and inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-a and interferon [INF]-c) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in pediatric SMA patients treated at Hiroshima University Hospital over 2 years. Results: This study analyzed pediatric SMA patients. While the CSF inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and INF-c) in these SMA children were unchanged, the CHIT1 levels decreased significantly from year 1 to 2 of treatment. We also found a trend toward an inverse correlation between the motor function score (HINE-2 scores) and CHIT1 level from year 1 to 2 of treatment. Conclusions: CHIT1 may be a CSF biomarker of the treatment response in pediatric SMA. (c) 2022 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology Published by Elsevier B.V.

We use a 500 m-resolution ice-sheet model parameterised using empirical glaciological, climatological and geological data specific to the model domain to simulate the entire Southern Alps icefield. We find that an LGM cooling of at least 6-6.5 degrees C is necessary to bring about valley glaciers that extend beyond the mountains. However, climate-topography thresholds related to the elevation and hypsometry of individual catchments control the gradient of the rate of glacier expansion in the domain, and in order to remain within geologically reconstructed LGM limits we find that the LGM cooling was most likely associated with a precipitation regime up to 25% drier than today. Wetter-than-present scenarios give rise to equilibrium line depressions and ice extents that are incompatible with empirical evidence. These results perhaps indicate that either the westerly air masses affecting New Zealand during the LGM were drier than today, or that they were weaker or zonally displaced with respect to present.

Although clinical trials have shown improvements in motor function in infants and children treated with the drug, data for adults are scarce. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of nusinersen in adults with 5q spinal muscular atrophy. Methods We did an observational cohort study at ten academic clinical sites in Germany. Patients with genetically confirmed 5q spinal muscular atrophy (age 16-65 years) with a homozygous deletion of exons 7, 8, or both, or with compound heterozygous mutations were eligible for inclusion and received nusinersen treatment in accordance with the label for a minimum treatment time of 6 months to a follow-up of up to 14 months. The primary outcome was the change in the total Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) score, assessed at months 6, 10, and 14, and based on pre-post comparisons. This study is registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (number DRKS00015702). Findings Between July 13, 2017, and May 1, 2019, 173 patients were screened, of whom 139 (80%) were eligible for data analysis. Of these, 124 (89%) were induded in the 6-month analysis, 92 (66%) in the 10-month analysis, and 57 (41%) in the 14-month analysis; patients with missing baseline HFMSE scores were excluded from these analyses. Mean HFMSE scores were significantly increased compared with baseline at 6 months (mean difference 1.73 [95% CI 1.05-2.411, p<0.0001), 10 months (2.58 [1- 76-3.39], p<0.001), and 14 months (3.12 [2.06-4.19], p<0.0001). Clinically meaningful improvements (>= 3 points increase) in HFMSE scores were seen in 35 (28%) of 124 patients at 6 months, 33 (35%) of 92 at 10 months, and 23 (40%) of 57 at 14 months. To 14-month follow-up, the most frequent adverse effects among 173 patients were headache (61[35%] patients), back pain (38[22%]), and nausea (19 [11%]). No serious adverse events were reported. Interpretation Despite the limitations of the observational study design and a slow functional decline throughout the natural disease course, our data provide evidence for the safety and efficacy of nusinersen in the treatment of adults with 5q spinal muscular atrophy, with clinically meaningful improvements in motor function in a real-world cohort.Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The spore ornamentation of the parasite was determined by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Spores of the parasite were pleomorphic, or elongated 3-5-4 mu m x 2-5-3-0 mu m in size. Two filaments were wound around the spore and originated from 2 'knob-like' posterior thickenings. Both filaments passed up one side of the spore together until just below the operculum whereupon each split and passed obliquely under the lip of the opercula lid. Each filament wrapped around the spore 4 times. The posterior thickenings seem to appear late in the development of the spore and were composed of spore wall material. A second set of branching tubular filaments composed of a different material was observed on the spore body although not on mature spores possessing a 'knob-like' posterior thickening. The ornamentation on the spores of the pearl oyster parasite was unique amongst described haplosporidian species where spore ornamentation is known.

Franz Josef Glacier, with its excellent terminus position record, location in the Southern Hemisphere, and its extreme sensitivity to climatic changes, is a key data point for understanding the magnitude and mechanisms of past and future climate changes. Here, we use a reconstructed mass balance record to drive an ice flow model which simulates the general retreat of the glacier during the 20th century. The model is then used to project future glacier variations, based on regionally downscaled climate change scenarios. The results indicate that, under a mean climate change scenario, the glacier will retreat 5 km and lose 38% of its mass by 2100. Different scenarios give a range of recession from 3.9 to 6.4 km, and a range of volume loss from 26% to 58%. On a global scale, the magnitude of the retreat is at the upper end of the range calculated for other, similar sized, glaciers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A literature review was undertaken between January 1950 and September 2009. Included studies described multidisciplinary cancer care and its relation to patient survival. Multidisciplinary care was defined as involvement of a team of clinical and allied specialists whose intent is individualized patient management. Studies were critically appraised for internal and external validity. All study designs were included. Results: Twenty-one studies met eligibility criteria for this review, including two systematic reviews, one abstract, and 18 original studies. Pooling of results was not possible due to heterogeneity of patient populations, disease sites, measured outcomes, and follow-up periods. Twelve studies (one prospective and six retrospective cohort studies, five before after series) reported statistically significant association between multidisciplinary care and patient survival. Conclusions: Due to methodological limitations, this review is unable to assert a causal relationship between multidisciplinary care and patient survival. In order to better evaluate this relationship, the oncology community must first accept a common definition of multidisciplinary care. Future efforts can then elucidate which aspects of multidisciplinary care impact survival, with consideration of confounding patient and tumour factors. J. Surg. Oncol. 2010;102:125-134.

From recent views of INE, community is considered as the mesoscopic preserving network's structure which can be combined with traditional approach of network's node proximities (microscopic structure preserving) to leverage the quality of network's representation. Most of contemporary INE models, like as: HIN2Vec, Metapath2Vec, HINE, etc. mainly concentrate on microscopic network structure preserving and ignore the mesoscopic (intra-community) structure of HIN. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of topic-driven meta-path-based embedding, namely W-Com2Vec (Weighted intra-community to vector). Our proposed W-Com2Vec model enables to capture richer semantic of node representation by applying the meta-path-based community-aware, node proximity preserving and topic similarity evaluation at the same time during the process of network embedding. We demonstrate comprehensive empirical studies on our proposed W-Com2Vec model with several real-world HINs.

Results: Forty-one MDT decisions were made for patients with FIGO Stage III/IV ovarian cancer. MDT case discussions were structured by four factors: Clinical Presentation, Patient Factors, Chair's Direction and Input from Other Specialties. Nurses were often quiet but facilitated discussion of patient factors. Junior doctors were not involved in MDT decision-making.

There were only 11 dedicated cancer geneticists across the 22 centres. Referrals were mainly concerned with breast (63%) bowel (18%) and ovarian (12%) cancers. Only 7% of referrals were for men and 3% were for individuals from ethnic minorities. Referral rates varied from 76 to 410 per million per annum across the regions.

Individuals at population-level genetic risk accounted for 27% of consultations (range 0%, 58%). Shortfalls in cancer genetics staff and in the provision of genetic testing and cancer surveillance have resulted in large regional variations in access to care.

To establish bench-marking data, we designed a prospective, 1 year regional study comparing key performance measures with established standards for the 28 hospital Trusts in the South and West of England involved in head and neck cancer care. 566 sequential patients with a newly-diagnosed head and neck cancer were included. Numbers referred and treated per hospital Trust were 1-58 and 1-65 respectively. 59% of patients received a pretreatment chest X-ray (standard 95%). 45% of patients were seen in a multidisciplinary clinic pretreatment (standard 95%), and this was proportional to the frequency of clinics held (P < 0.0001). Median number of cases treated per surgeon was 4 (1-26), and by radiotherapist was 10 (1-51). Times between parts of the process of oral cancer care were closer to the standards than those for laryngeal cancer. Two patients were entered into a clinical trial. One had a quality-of-life score. Thus, in 1996-1997, in the South and West of England, there were major discrepancies between actual performance and established standards in many fundamental aspects of head and neck cancer care. Re-audit is essential to determine if the implementation of the Calman-Hine report has resulted in improvements.

Through an analysis of 5 years of Hospital Episode Statistics for the West Midlands region (1992-1997), we have investigated whether there is evidence of increasing numbers of patients with breast. colorectal or ovarian cancer being treated by high throughput, i.e. sub-specialist surgeons, who carry out more than a threshold level of primary cancer resections annually. The proportion of cases treated by the high-volume breast, colorectal and ovarian cancer surgeons increased annually during the 5 years. The absolute number of consultant firms who undertook breast cancer resections reduced during the 5 years; but the number doing colorectal and ovarian surgery increased. Throughout the 5 years, half of the ovarian cancer resections were carried out by consultant firms who did very few procedures - less than 5 of these procedures annually. The relatively high case-load, the elective nature of breast cancer surgery and an early policy change have undoubtedly facilitated the move towards sub-specialization. The weaker trends for colorectal and ovarian cancer surgery suggest continued monitoring is required to ensure that there is a reduction in the proportion of people treated by surgeons who undertake few cancer resections annually.

Instead of using an ice-flow rule in the model, a simple basal-shear-stress rule is calibrated to yield glacier surface slope as a function of ice depth. We test the model against known temperature cooling constraints required to emplace the Little Ice Age moraines. We then use our model to represent the reduction of ablation due to a rock avalanche falling on to the ablation zone of Franz Josef glacier about 10 000 to 13 000 years ago; it shows that at the temperature prevailing at that time (< 2 degrees C cooler than at present, according to proxy data), rock avalanche debris covering a proportion of the ablation zone could cause an advance of the glacier from near Canavan's Knob to the Waiho Loop. By contrast, the 5 degrees C cooling required for a purely climatically-driven advance to the Loop contradicts proxy data. These findings are of significance to the ongoing debate on the climatic significance, or otherwise, of the Waiho Loop Moraine.

Despite this acknowledgement, it can be argued that less is known about carers' experience in the cancer treatment context. Carers can be defined as someone who shares the experience of cancer with the patient. The aim of this study was to explore the lived experience of caregivers in a chemotherapy day hospital and how this compared with their experience of inpatient care. Using a phenomenological approach, face-to-face interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of ten caregivers. Data were analysed using Polkinghorne's [1995. Narrative Knowing Et the Human Sciences. University of New York Press, Albany] two stages of narrative analysis. The findings indicated that the caregivers experienced similar transitions to the patients with regards to health-illness transition and organisational transitions. The caregivers adopted various rotes in the day hospital such as Companion 'being with' their relative, Protector 'keeping an eye'; Practical Caregiver and assuming an Advocate Rote. The findings of this study are important for cancer nursing practice as health professionals need to acknowledge the rote of carers in the chemotherapy day hospital setting and facilitate their involvement in care.

This work presents a design of a 7-kW integrated EH machine and studies its electric motor heat transfer phenomena both experimentally and numerically. Further, to better match the torque and speed performances of the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) and the hydraulic machine a planetary step-down gear is utilized to triple the output torque of the PMSM. The integrated motor and gear system is then connected to a bent axis piston hydraulic machine, which is capable of operating both as a motor and a pump. Two different electric motor cooling approaches are investigated. The first cooling approach is to use some hydraulic oil inside the motor-gear chamber to let it flow freely as a result of the rotor rotation and move the losses to the surface of the converter cover, which is equipped with some air cooling fins. In the second approach, the oil flows through the converter and removes the losses more effectively. Motor losses and thermal behaviour are studied within these two cooling approaches.

This study assesses whether geographical inequalities changed following these policy developments by analysing the trend in 1-year relative survival in the 28 cancer networks of England. Methods Population-based age-standardised relative survival at 1 year is estimated for 1.4 million patients diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus, stomach, colon, lung, breast (women) or cervix in England during 1991-2006 and followed up to 2007. Regional and deprivation-specific life tables are built to adjust survival estimates for differences in background mortality. Analysis is divided into three calendar periods: 1991-5, 1996-2000 and 2001-6. Funnel plots are used to assess geographical variation in survival over time. Results One-year relative survival improved for all cancers except cervical cancer. There was a wide geographical variation in survival with generally lower estimates in northern England. This northesouth divide became less marked over time, although the overall number of cancer networks that were lower outliers compared with the England value remained stable. Breast cancer was the only cancer for which there was a marked reduction in geographical inequality in survival over time. Conclusion Policy changes over the past two decades coincided with improved relative survival, without an increase in geographical variation. The northesouth divide in relative survival became less pronounced over time but geographical inequalities persist.

The densities and genetic diversity tend to be higher in the Ozarks than in the Great Lakes region. A phylogeographic analysis indicates that the Ozarks, with its unglaciated fens, is the likely source for the populations currently inhabiting the formerly glaciated Great Lakes region, and genetic diversity decreases with increasing distance from the Ozarks. This work illustrates the inadequacy of using geography alone to identify a population as marginal and of less conservation concern. We also reanalyzed genetic data on the Great Lakes populations, where several populations have been extirpated over the last several decades. We show that the populations in the Great Lakes region have already lost more than 30% of their genetic diversity over just several decades, and the phylogeographic analysis indicates that increased fragmentation is a possibility in this region due to local extirpations.

The glacier valleys are important tourist destinations that are subject to landslide hazards. Both valleys contain actively retreating glaciers; experience high rainfall; and are proximal to the Alpine Fault, which is a major source of seismic hazard on the west coast. We considered the life safety risk from rockfalls, soil/rock avalanches, and flows that either are seismically triggered or occur aseismically. To determine the range in risk values and dominant contributing variables to the risk, we modelled nine different risk scenarios where we incrementally changed the variables used in the risk model to account for the underlying uncertainty. The scenarios represent our central estimate of the risk, e.g. neither optimistic nor conservative, through to our upper estimate of the risk. We include in these estimates the impact time-variable factors, such as a recently reactivated landslide, have had on locally increasing risk and the time-elapsed since the last major earthquake on the nearby Alpine Fault. We disaggregated our risk results to determine the dominant drivers in landslide risk, which highlighted the importance of considering dynamic time-variable risk scenarios and the changing contributions to risk from aseismic versus seismic landslides.

No difference between specialist (high volume) and non-specialist centres was detected for factors important in survival. Pathological staging was good with over 70% reporting tumour size and grade. A small number of patients were undertreated; after conservative surgery, 10% (19) of women did not receive radiotherapy, and 15% (8) of node-positive premenopausal women did not receive chemotherapy or ovarian ablation. In contrast, a significant trend with hospital volume was found for several quality of life factors. These included access to a specialist breast surgeon and specialist breast nurses, availability of fine-needle aspiration (FNA), which ranged from 84% in high-volume to 42% in low-volume centres, and quality of surgery (axillary clearance rates ranged from 51% to 8% and sampling of less than three nodes from 3% to 25% for high- and very low-volume centres respectively). Confidential feedback of results to surgeons was welcomed and initiated change. The summary information gave purchasers information relevant to the evaluation of cancer services. While the audit applied present standards to past practice, it provided the impetus for prospective audit of current practice (now being implemented in North Thames).",,,,,,"pollock, allyson/0000-0002-7388-3110",,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-0920,,,,,JUN,1997,75.0,11,,,,,1652,1659,,10.1038/bjc.1997.281,0,,,,,,,,9184182.0000,,,,,WOS:A1997XC74400014,0.0

Within this dramatic and ongoing retreat, both glaciers have experienced periods of re-advance. The record from Franz Josef Glacier is the most detailed, and shows major advances from 1946 to 1951 (340 m), 1965-1967 (400 m), 1983-1999 (1420 m) and 2004-2008 (280 m). At Fox Glacier the record is similar, with advances recorded during 1964-1968 (60 m), 1985-1999 (710 m) and 2004-2008 (290 m). Apart from the latest advance event, the magnitude of advance has been greater at Franz Josef Glacier, suggesting a higher length sensitivity. Analysis of the relationship between glacier length and a reconstructed annual equilibrium line altitude (ELA) record shows that the glaciers react very quickly to ELA variations - with the greatest correlation at 3-4 years' lag. The present (2014) retreat is the fastest retreat in the records of both glaciers. While decadal length fluctuations have been linked to hemispheric ocean-atmosphere variability, the overall reduction in length is a clear sign of twentieth century warming. However, documenting glacier length changes can be challenging; especially when increased surface debris-cover makes identification of the 'true' terminus a convoluted process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Most recently, Franz Josef Glacier has entered into a phase of strong retreat and downwasting, with the increasing emergence of debris on the surface in the ablation zone. Previously at Franz Josef Glacier, melt has only been measured on bare ice. During February 2012, a network of 11 ablation stakes was drilled into locations of varying supraglacial debris thickness on the lower glacier. Mean ablation rates over 9 days varied over the range 1.210.1 cm d1, and were closely related to debris thickness. Concomitant observations of air temperature allowed the application of a degree-day approach to the calculation of melt rates, with air temperature providing a strong indicator of melt. Degree-day factors (d f) varied over the range 1.18.1 mm d1 degrees C1 (mean of 4.4 mm d1 degrees C1), comparable with rates reported in other studies. Mapping of the current debris cover revealed 0.7 km2 of the 4.9 km2 ablation zone surface was debris-covered, with thicknesses ranging 150 cm. Based on measured debris thicknesses and d f, ablation on debris-covered areas of the glacier is reduced by a total of 41% which equates to a 6% reduction in melt overall across the entire ablation zone.

The mineralogy was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Mossbauer spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). For the Fe-Mn oxide crusts in the HHF, varying amounts of volcanic fragments and some seawater contributions were recognized, along with higher concentrations of Mn, Al, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, Mo, elevated Sigma(REE) and negative Ce anomalies. In contrast, the Si-rich oxide samples of the MHF were enriched in Cu, Pb and Ba, indicative of proximity to a hydrothermal jet. Moreover, conductive cooling of hydrothermal fluid evoked the Si-rich deposit formation in the MHF. The Sr, Nd and Pb isotope data provided further constraints regarding the source and formation of the Fe-Si-Mn deposits in the VFR by showing that the samples of the HHF are a mixture of three components, namely, hydrothermal fluid, seawater and volcanic materials, whereas the samples of the MHF were dominated by hydrothermal fluids. The seawater had a minor influence on the Nd isotope data, and the Pb isotope data exhibited a close association with the substrate rock and preformed volcaniclastic layers in this area. The occurrence of relatively high Mn/Fe ratios in the hydrothermal deposits of this area may be a good indicator of the propagating activities of the VFR over geological time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Part 3. Issues for the Macmillan Nurse role,PALLIATIVE MEDICINE,,,,,,,,,,,,"The remit and boundaries of the Macmillan Nursing role in the UK have been called into question recently by a number of policy-driven changes. The rapid appointment of tumour site-specific nurses and the development of posts for palliative medicine, stemming originally from the Calman-Hine recommendations for reorganizing cancer services, have created unparalleled challenges of adaptation to new working practices and procedures. The extent to which Macmillan Nurses are adapting to these new demands was addressed as part of a major evaluation study of UK Macmillan Nursing in 12 sites commissioned by the UK charity Macmillan Cancer Relief. This paper draws upon semi-structured interviews with Macmillan Nurses (n = 44) and their key colleagues (n = 47). We found that differences of expectation between Macmillan Nurses and their managers about the appropriate focus of their work lead to problems of role ambiguity and role conflict; that Macmillan Nurses lack resources with which to develop an educative and consultative role and yet substitute for inadequacies in skills and knowledge of other health care staff; and that problems are associated in co-working with newly appointed cancer site-specific nurses and palliative medicine colleagues. Macmillan Nursing has a crucial role to play in meeting the objectives in the NHS Cancer Plan. However, in order to ensure that their expertise is used efficiently and effectively, there is an urgent need to clarify the nature and scope of the Macmillan Nurse role, to attend to issues of team working and to improve the skills of nonspecialist staff in palliative care.",,,,,"Webb, Thomas/E-8946-2010; Clark, David/A-1645-2009; seymour, jane/C-1610-2009","Webb, Thomas/0000-0001-9320-0068; seymour, jane/0000-0002-9384-2551; Haviland, Joanne/0000-0001-5728-3636; Corner, Jessica/0000-0002-2240-8133; Normand, Charles/0000-0002-0885-5754",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-2163,,,,,SEP,2002,16.0,5,,,,,386,394,,10.1191/0269216302pm586oa,0,,,,,,,,12380656.0000,,,,,WOS:000178368200004,0.0

We conducted a field experiment to quantify Cirsium arvense responses to varying defoliation regimes of neighboring forage implemented for 2 years under high or low fertility conditions. Defoliation regimes were based on common grazing systems, and included: (1) high intensity high frequency (HIHF) defoliation simulating continuous grazing, (2) high intensity low frequency (HILF), (3) low intensity high frequency (LIHF), and (4) deferred (DEF) defoliation to peak growth in late summer. All vegetation except C. arvense was defoliated during the growing season to examine weed responses to changes in neighboring forage abundance. Year-end C. arvense biomass at the end of the study was greatest in the HINE treatment and lowest in the DEF, with the LIHF and HILF treatments intermediate in response. The HILF treatment also provided improved suppression of C arvense biomass relative to the LIHF, although this response was inconsistent among sites. Trends in C. arvense shoot densities among defoliation treatments were similar to those for biomass. While weed abundance was lower in the absence of fertilization, rankings among defoliation treatments remained the same. Notably, trends in forage biomass among defoliation regimes followed a pattern opposite that of C. arvense, and are implicated in observed weed decreases. Our results indicate that defoliation regimes enhancing forage growth and biomass, particularly a DEF or HILF regime, reduce C. arvense the most. Grazing systems that employ these defoliation regimes are therefore likely to optimize the interspecific competitive suppression of C arvense. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Women (n=735) were randomized to a surgical consultation with (trial group) or without (control group) specialist genetic risk assessment and the possible offer of presymptomatic genetic testing. Participants completed questionnaires before and immediately after the consultation to assess anxiety, cancer worry, perceived risk, interest in genetic: testing and satisfaction. Responses of subgroups of women stratified by clinicians as low, moderate, or high risk were analyzed. There were no significant main effects of study intervention on any outcome variable. Regardless of risk information, there was a statistically significant reduction in state anxiety (P<0.001). Reductions in cancer worry and perceived risk were significant for women at low or moderate risk (P<0.001) but not those at high risk, and satisfaction was significantly lower in the high risk group (P<0.001). In high risk women who received specialist genetic input, there was a marginally significant trend towards increased perceived risk. The effect of risk information on interest in genetic testing was not significant. Breast care specialists other than geneticists might provide assessments of breast cancer risk, reassuring women at reduced risk and targeting those at high risk for specialist genetic counselling and testing services.

During the field campaign, an intertidal bar migrated onshore and stabilized as a berm on the foreshore. A new intertidal bar occurred on the lower beach face, migrated onshore on the rising tide and finally merged with the pre-existing berm. As the tide continued to rise, the new berm translated further onshore as an intertidal bar to the uppermost part of the foreshore. The sediment transport during the berm transition was onshore directed in the upper swash and offshore directed in the lower swash. This berm development can be described through both the neap-berm, ridge-and-runnel and berm-ridge development concepts proposed by Hine (Sedimentology 1979; 26: 333-351), and all three stages were observed during only three tidal cycles. The main factors controlling this fast transformation were the gentle slope of the cross-shore profile, rapid water level translation rates, Substantial swash overtopping of the berm, and low infiltration rates. Despite the onshore migration of intertidial bars and berm formation, no net foreshore accretion took place during the field campaign. This was largely clue to the formation of rip channels with strong rip currents cutting through the intertidal bars and the berm, which acted as a sediment drain in the profile.

Anisotropy of anhysteretic remanence magnetization (AARM) analysis is performed in samples taken from different parts of the granite to establish that the magnetite grains define a fabric. Along with microstructural studies, the AARM data help conclude that this fabric is on account of shape preferred orientation (SPO) of the magnetite grains. The intensity of magnetite fabric (degree of anisotropy of the AARM ellipsoid) is higher in the southern parts as compared to the north, which is inferred to indicate a strain gradient. Electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) analyses of magnetite grains were performed to determine if there are intracrystalline deformation features that could have influenced magnetite shape and SPO, and thus AARM data. Detailed crystallographic orientation data coupled with orientation contrast imaging did not reveal any subgrains and/or significant variations in crystallographic orientations within magnetite grains. Instead, grains exhibit fractures and are in places associated with quartz pressure fringes. Hence, neither the SPO nor the variation in the magnetite fabric intensity in the granite can be attributed to intracrysta Hine deformation of magnetite by dislocation creep. It is concluded that the magnetite grains were rheologically rigid and there was relative movement between the magnetite and the matrix minerals (quartz, feldspar and biotite). These matrix minerals actually define the fabric attractor and the magnetite grains passively rotated to align with it. Thus it is demonstrated that the magnetite fabric in the granite stems from rigid body movement rather than dislocation creep. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we provide additional evidence that HNE acts as an inflammatory mediator by elucidating the signaling cascades targeted in OA chondrocytes leading to cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression. HINE induced COX-2 protein and mRNA levels with accompanying increases in prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) production. In contrast, HNE had no effect on basal iNOS expression or nitric oxide (NO) release. However, HNE strongly inhibited IL-1 beta-induced iNOS or NO production. Transient transfection experiments revealed that the ATF/CRE site (-58/-53) is essential for HNE-induced COX-2 promoter activation and indeed HNE induced ATF-2 and CREB-1 phosphorylation as well as ATF/CRE binding activity. Overexpression of p38 MAPK enhanced the HNE-induced ATF/CRE luciferase reporter plasmid activation, COX-2 synthesis and promoter activity. HNE abrogated IL-1 P-induced iNOS expression and promoter activity mainly through NF-kappa B site (-5, 817/-5, 808) possibly via suppression of IKK alpha-induced I kappa B alpha phosphorylation and NF-kappa B/p65 nuclear translocation. Upon examination of upstream signaling components, we found that IKK alpha was inactivated through HNE/ IKK alpha adduct formation.

One of the more recent developments along this line is in aminocatalysis, which leads to the direct a-functionalization of simple aldehydes and ketones. However, most of the advances have been achieved with linear aldehydes and ketones as substrates. Effective aminocatalysis with alpha-branched carbonyls, particularly alpha-branched ketones, has remained elusive. The primary difficulty arises from the space-demanding a-substituent, which impedes iminium/enamine formation. In 2005, synthetic organic chemists revived catalysis using primary amines, which brought new attention to these challenges, because of the conformational flexibility of primary amines. On the basis of early biomimetic studies by Hine, in 2007 we developed the bioinspired chiral primary amine catalysts featuring primary-tertiary diamines. This type of catalyst involves enamine/iminium catalysis, and we could apply this chemistry to all of the major types of ketones and aldehydes. In this Account, we present research from our laboratory that significantly expands aminocatalysis to include alpha-branched ketones such as beta-ketocarbonyls and alpha-substituted vinyl ketones. Our primary amine catalysis methodology, when used alone or in conjunction with metal catalysts, provides convenient access to both enantiopure alpha-tertiary and quaternary ketones, structures that are not available via other approaches. Our mechanistic studies showed that acidic additives play the critical role in facilitating catalytic turnover, most likely by shuttling protons during the enamine/iminium tautomerizations. These additives are also critical to induce the desired stereochemistry via ammonium N-H hydrogen bonding. Proton transfer by shuttling is also stereoselective, resulting in enantioselective enamine protonation as observed in the reactions of alpha-substituted vinyl ketones. In addition, we have carried out density functional theory studies that help to delineate the origins of the stereoselectivity in these reactions.",,,,,"Fu, Niankai/AAH-7238-2021","Fu, Niankai/0000-0002-7453-3569",,,,,,,,,,,,,0001-4842,1520-4898,,,,APR,2015,48.0,4,,,,,986,997,,10.1021/acs.accounts.5b00028,0,,,,,,,,25831453.0000,,,,,WOS:000353429400010,0.0

In Canada, Ontario has standards for formal multidisciplinary cancer conferences (MCCs), but other provinces/territories do not. This study aimed to stocktake MCCs for breast cancer in Canadian sites participating in the RUBY cohort study (Reducing the Burden of Breast Cancer in Young Women) to better understand variations in multidisciplinary care across Canada and to add to the international literature. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with surgeons and surgical oncologists representing 34 clinical centres participating in RUBY. Questions were grouped according to: type of multidisciplinary care, implementation, function, practice, participation and presentation, operation, and demographics, and included a mix of Likert-based, tick box and open-ended questions. Results: Twenty-two responses (65%) were received. 91% of respondents reported that formal MCCs are part of regular practice. However, variation exists in the supports in place for ongoing implementation of MCCs, the understanding of the functions of MCCs, and the patients presented for discussion. Results also suggest less formalized processes for MCC in provinces without practice standards. Conclusions: Response differences between Ontario and elsewhere suggest that standards for MCC and supports for their implementation make a positive difference in their operation. However, ongoing operational challenges and issues with attendance exist for all sites and suggest that along with development of practice standards, incentives for participation and further education on benefits and function of MCC may support uptake of MCCs in clinical practice.

Strontium isotope compositions of sulfides from the Lau basin reflect the presence of anhydrite and barite inclusions. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of these two sulfate minerals vary from 0.7045 to 0.7078 and are interpreted as the result of mixing between various proportions of the hydrothermal end-member and pure seawater. The microthermometric study of fluid inclusions reveals that mixing with seawater involved different kinds of aqueous fluid end-members. A high-temperature Mg-depleted end-member of high salinity (greater than or equal to 5.5 wt % eq NaCl) was found at the Vai Lili site. A uncommon low-temperature Mg-rich end-member was also identified at the Hine Hina site in association with barite deposition. At the Vai Lili site, very low salinity fluids were produced in addition to a very saline brine (greater than or equal to 30 wt % NaCl) that was trapped inside anhydrite precipitated from an active vent at a temperature of 342 degrees C. Oxygen isotope ratios of water inclusions range from 2 parts per thousand to 4.4 parts per thousand for chalcopyrite, barite, and sphalerite minerals. The O-18 enrichment and the high salinities of many fluids from the Lau basin are accounted for by the specificity of the back are setting.

This response is expected to continue, and will result in maritime glaciers making a large contribution to sea level rise over the coming decades. Maritime glaciers in the New Zealand Southern Alps provide an opportunity to learn more about climate-glacier mass balance relationships in a high precipitation setting, and how these relationships might change in the future. Ice core and direct glaciological measurements are used to construct a 24-year record of net accumulation, the longest of its type in New Zealand. We demonstrate that variations in net accumulation on Tasman Glacier are more strongly influenced by temperature than by precipitation. Further, it is temperature during the ablation season that exerts most control. Atmospheric circulation patterns, in particular the state of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM), were found to influence net accumulation. When the SAM is positive and the ENSO in a La Nina phase, easterly and northerly wind anomalies are enhanced, temperatures increase in the Southern Alps region and more negative glacier mass balances result. Conversely when SAM is negative and ENSO in an El Nino phase, westerly and southerly wind anomalies occur, and temperatures decrease in the Southern Alps region. In this case, glacier mass balance is more likely to be positive. However, relationships between glacier mass balance and these atmospheric circulation modes are not simply linear, with some of the lowest net accumulation years associated with inverse polarity between the SAM and the ENSO.

To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of nusinersen, a promising intervention for SMA, we conducted a systematic search and meta-analysis of the published randomized control trials (RCTs) of nusinersen for SMA. Materials and methods: Utilizing the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), we searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and Clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 22 July 2021. Results: Three RCTs satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria covered 274 patients: 178 patients in the nusinersen group.

On Volcano 19, the lucinid Bathyaustriella thionipta co-occurred with the sea star Rumbleaster eructans at two sedimented sites. At one site, live clams were significantly smaller (in shell length, SL) than dead ones (showing signs of predation by sea stars), whereas at the other site, both, live and dead clams had similarly small SL, suggesting a size refuge from predation. At Volcano 1, mussel beds of Bathymodiolus sp. were present in two areas: one with vigorous hydrothermal discharge ('Bubbles'), and another with some discharge but also in the photic zone ('Barracuda'). Mussels were smaller in SL at 'Bubbles' than at 'Barracuda', a consequence of either a younger population or a nutritionally less favourable environment at 'Bubbles'. At 'Barracuda', mussels utilized both chemo-and photosynthetically derived carbon, possibly allowing them to reach larger sizes. At Hine Hina on Valu Fa Ridge, a population of mussels was composed mainly of large individuals (>55 mm SL), estimated to be on average 7-13 years old. The combination of old mussels, absence of recruits, and presence of abundant empty mussel shells and of dead chimneys suggests that this is a waning hydrothermal system. My results indicate that the population structure of bivalves at hydrothermal vents can provide information on the processes that regulate these populations, which in turn can be used to generate testable hypotheses for the same location, should return visits occur, or for other locations with similarly structured populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0173-9565,1439-0485,,,,AUG,2015,36.0,,,1,SI,,62,70,,10.1111/maec.12248,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000360368300005,0.0

We aimed to provide real-world data on motor function and safety after gene replacement therapy in different patient subgroups. Methods We did a protocol-based, multicentre prospective observational study between Sept 21, 2019, and April 20, 2021, in 18 paediatric neuromuscular centres in Germany and Austria. All children with spinal muscular atrophy types 1 and 2 receiving onasemnogene abeparvovec were included in our cohort, and there were no specific exclusion criteria. Motor function was assessed at the time of gene replacement therapy and 6 months afterwards, using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) and Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE) scores. Additionally, in children pretreated with nusinersen, motor function was assessed before and after treatment switch. Off-target adverse events were analysed with a focus on liver function, thrombocytopaenia, and potential cardiotoxicity. Findings 76 children (58 pretreated with nusinersen and 18 who were nusinersen naive) with spinal muscular atrophy were treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec at a mean age of 16.8 months (range 0.8-59.0, IQR 9-23) and a mean weight of 9.1 kg (range 4.0-15.0, IQR 7.4-10.6). In 60 patients with available data, 49 had a significant improvement on the CHOP-INTEND score (>= 4 points) and HFMSE score (>= 3 points). Mean CHOP INTEND scores increased significantly in the 6 months after therapy in children younger than 8 months (n=16; mean change 13.8 [SD 8.5]; p<0.0001) and children aged between 8 and 24 months (n=34; 7.7 [SD 5.2]; p<0.0001), but not in children older than 24 months (n=6; 2.5 [SD 5.2]; p=1.00). In the 45 children pretreated with nusinersen and had available data, CHOP INTEND score increased by 8.8 points (p=0.0003) at 6 months after gene replacement therapy. No acute complications occurred during infusion of onasemnogene abeparvovec, but 56 (74%) patients had treatment-related side-effects. Serious adverse events occurred in eight (11%) children. Liver enzyme elevation significantly increased with age and weight at treatment. Six (8%) patients developed acute liver dysfunction. Other adverse events included pyrexia (n=47 [62%]), vomiting or loss of appetite (41 [54%]), and thrombocytopenia (n=59 [78%]). Prednisotone treatment was significantly prolonged with a mean duration of 15.7 weeks (IQR 9-19), mainly due to liver enzyme elevation. Cardiac adverse events were rare; only two patients had abnormal echocardiogram and echocardiography findings. Interpretation This study provides class IV evidence that children with spinal muscular atrophy aged 24 months or younger and patients pretreated with nusinersen significantly benefit from gene replacement therapy, but adverse events can be severe and need to be closely monitored.

Joinpoint analysis was used to identify the year when trends in all age mortality began to change. Results From 1989 to 2006, there was a median reduction in breast cancer mortality of 19%, ranging from a 45% reduction in Iceland to a 17% increase in Romania. Breast cancer mortality decreased by >= 20% in 15 countries, and the reduction tended to be greater in countries with higher mortality in 1987-9. England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland had the second, third, and fourth largest decreases of 35%, 29%, and 30%, respectively. In France, Finland, and Sweden, mortality decreased by 11%, 12%, and 16%, respectively. In central European countries mortality did not decline or even increased during the period. Downward mortality trends usually started between 1988 and 1996, and the persistent reduction from 1999 to 2006 indicates that these trends may continue.

J.",,,An investigation into the relationship between input-output nonlinearities and rate-induced nonlinearities of click-evoked otoacoustic emissions recorded using maximum length sequences,HEARING RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"The maximum length sequence (MLS) technique allows otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) to be recorded using clicks presented at very high presentation rates. It has previously been found that increasing the click presentation rate leads to increasing suppression (termed rate-suppression) of the MLS evoked OAE (Hine, J.E., Thornton, A.R.D., 1997. Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions recorded using maximum length sequences as a function of stimulus rate and level. Ear Hear. 18, 121-128). It has been suggested that the source of rate-suppression arises from the same nonlinear processes that give rise to the well-known nonlinear growth of OAEs. Based on this assumption, a simple model of rate-suppression (Kapadia, S., Lutman, M.E., 2001. Static input-output nonlinearity as the source of nonlinear effects in maximum length sequence click-evoked OAEs. Br. J. Audiol. 35, 103-112) predicts that both input-output (I/O) nonlinearity and rate-suppression can be unified by characterising the stimulus in terms of its acoustic power which, at high rates, is proportional to the click presentation rate. The objective of this study was to test this simple model by recording MLS OAEs from a group of normally hearing adults over a range of stimulus rates from 40 to 5000 clicks/s, and of stimulus levels from 45 to 70 dB peSPL. The results are broadly in agreement with the predictions from the model, though there appears to be some tendency for the model to slightly overestimate the degree of rate-suppression for a given degree of I/O nonlinearity. It is also suggested that the model may break down more significantly in the presence of spontaneous OAEs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Many studies have concluded that the first-order control on mass balance sensitivity is climatic, where higher-precipitation (and less continental) glaciers are most sensitive while lower-precipitation (and more continental) glaciers are least sensitive. The Southern Alps in New Zealand experience a limited range of continentality (9-13 K) but strong gradients in precipitation (2.5-11 m a(-1)). Using an energy balance model applied on a regional scale we find that the central Southern Alps glaciers are very sensitive to temperature change (1.9 m w.e. a(-1) K-1, with a range of -1.1 to -4.0 m w.e. a(-1) K-1) and that an 82% increase in precipitation is required to offset a 1 K warming. Spatial variations in mass balance sensitivity cannot be simply explained as a function of precipitation. Topographic effects are important, and we find that debris cover reduces mass balance sensitivity. Mass balance amplitude, which takes into account debris cover, hypsometry and other topographic characteristics, is a better predictor of mass balance sensitivity than precipitation. The mass balance gradient is almost as good a predictor indicating that hypsometry is not a necessary component of sensitivity calculations. Estimating mass balance sensitivity as a function of mass balance gradient allows for parameterizations of mass balance sensitivity based on glacier inventory data. This provides a simple and robust way to assess glacier mass balance sensitivity on a global scale, which may refine future predictions of valley glacier melt and its contribution to sea level rise.",,,,,,"Mackintosh, Andrew/0000-0002-6430-4711",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9003,2169-9011,,,,JAN 7,2012,117.0,,,,,,,,F01003,10.1029/2011JF002064,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000298931600001,0.0

Current in vitro models for avian adipogenesis require adipogenic inducers including dexamethasone, 3-isobut yl-1-met hylxant hine (IBMX), fatty acids, or insulin. However, problems still remain in these models for testing/screening potential nutritional, hormonal, and pharmaceutical factors because of interfering/overriding effects of the inducing factors. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a simple in vitro method for avian adipogenesis. In this study, chicken serum (CS) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were compared for adipogenic potential using chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF). Oil-red 0 staining at 4 d in culture of CEF under CS revealed that lipid droplet formation was increased by CS in a dose-dependent manner (0 to 10%). On the contrary, all concentrations of FBS (0 to 10%) alone did not show lipid droplet formation. In accordance with the morphological data of CEF, mRNA expression of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation/determination, fatty acid uptake, and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, were most significantly up-regulated by 10% CS at d 4 compared to 1 or 5% CS. In addition, embryonic cells isolated from quail (QEF) at E5, duck (DEF) at E6, and turkey (TEF) at E6, were tested for adipogenic differentiation by media containing the same concentrations of CS. Similar to the morphological data from CEF, quantitative data of the Oil-red 0 staining showed that lipid droplet formation in QEF, DEF, and TEF was increased by CS in a dosedependent manner (0 to 10%). The current study demonstrates that CS alone can induce adipogenesis on embryonic fibroblasts of various poultry species.

A suggested more precise technique,HELLENIC JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE,,,,,,,,,,,,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative error (RE) in the thyroid absorbed dose (TD) of iodine-131 (I-131) in patients with Graves' disease comparing the simplified Quimby-Marinelli-Hine formula method (sQMHF) and the Standard Operational Procedures for dosimetry (SOPD) recommended by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 45 patients with Graves' disease 12 men and 33 women; age 44.1 +/- 12.8 years. Thyroid mass (TM) was measured using ultrasound. Uptake of I-131 (RAIU) was tested at 2, 4-6, 24, 48-72, and 96-168h after its administration and the half-life (T-1/2eff) and resident time (RT) of I-131 were computed. According to the sQMHF, a prescribed TD of 75Gy required 3.7MBq/g of I-131, correction based on the RAIU24h and T-1/2eff. Subsequently, the therapeutic TD was computed according to the SOPD and the RE was recorded. The data were analyzed using t-tests. RESULTS: The TM, RAIU24h, therapeutic TD, and RE were 36.5 +/- 23.9g, 0.54 +/- 0.14, 89.4 +/- 9.4Gy, and -0.01 +/- 0.02, respectively. There was a significant difference (t-value 9.84, P<0.01) between the prescribed and therapeutic TD because the sQMHF ignores the absorbed dose deposited in the thyroid during the first 24h, which is included in the SOPD. In addition, the RE was significantly smaller than the variable coefficient (VC) of the therapeutic TD (t=-39.6, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: When the activity of I-131 was calculated using the simplified Q-M-H formula, the therapeutic absorbed thyroid dose was significantly higher than what was expected for the prescribed dose. Precision of the individualized therapeutic absorbed dose could be improved by computing the activity of I-131 using the standard operational procedures for dosimetry of the EANM.",,,,,"Chen, Yangchun/B-3123-2014; WANG, YUE/GWQ-9256-2022","Chen, Yangchun/0000-0002-9076-6581;",,,,,,,,,,,,,1108-1430,1790-5427,,,,SEP-DEC,2017,20.0,3,,,,,217,221,,,,,,,,,,,29177256.0000,,,,,WOS:000418493200006,0.0

The results are presented of treatment of advanced and recurrent colorectal cancer from a centre where a dedicated multidisciplinary team (MDT) is central to the management. Method All consecutive MDT referrals between 2010 and 2014 were examined. Analysis was undertaken of the referral pathway, site, selection process, management decision, R0 resection rate, mortality/morbidity/ Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification of morbidity, length of stay (LOS) and improvement of quality of life. Results There were 954 referrals. These included locally advanced primary rectal cancer (LAPRC b-TME) (39.0%), rectal recurrence (RR) (22.0%), locally advanced primary colon cancer (LAPCC T3c/d-T4) (21.1%), colon cancer recurrence (CR) (12.4%), locally advanced primary anal cancer (LAPAC-failure of CRT/T3c/d-T4) (3.0%) and anal cancer recurrence (AR) (2.2%). Among these patients 271 operations were performed, 212 primary and 59 for recurrence. These included 16 sacrectomies, 134 total pelvic exenterations and 121 other multi-visceral exenterative procedures. An R0 resection (no microscopic margin involvement) was achieved in 94.4% and R1 (microscopic margin involvement) in 5.1%. In LAPRC b-TME the R0 rate was 96.1% and for RR it was 79%. The LOS varied from 13.3 to 19.9 days. RR operations had the highest morbidity (CD 1-2, 33.3%) and LAPRC operations had the highest rate of CD 3-4 complications (18.4%).

During the larval and pupal life stages mosquitoes are aquatic. With the emergence of the adult they become terrestrial. This shifts the organism within minutes from an aquatic environment to a terrestrial environment where dehydration has to be avoided. In addition, female mosquitoes take large blood meals, which present an entirely new set of challenges to salt and water homeostasis. Methods: To determine differences in gene expression associated with these different life stages, we performed an RNA-seq analysis of the main diuretic tissue in A. aegypti, the Malpighian tubules. We compared transcript abundance in 4th instar larvae to that of adult females and analyzed the data with a focus on transcripts that encode proteins potentially involved in diuresis, like water and solute channels as well as ion transporters. We compared our results against the model of potassium-and sodium chloride excretion in the Malpighian tubules proposed by Hine et al. (2014), which involves at least eight ion transporters and a proton-pump. Results: We found 3, 421 of a total number of 17, 478 (19.6%) unique transcripts with a P < 0.05 and at least a 2.5 fold change in expression levels between the two groups. We identified two novel transporter genes that are highly expressed in the adult Malpighian tubules, which have not previously been part of the transport model in this species and may play important roles in diuresis. We also identified candidates for hypothesized sodium and chloride channels. Detoxification genes were generally higher expressed in larvae. Significance: This study represents the first comparison of Malpighian tubule transcriptomes between larval and adult A. aegypti mosquitoes, highlighting key differences in their renal systems that arise as they transform from an aquatic filter-feeding larval stage to a terrestrial, blood-feeding adult stage.",,,,,"LI, yi/HKO-0480-2023; Piermarini, Peter/AAO-5666-2021","Piermarini, Peter/0000-0003-1020-5774",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-042X,,,,,MAY 9,2017,8.0,,,,,,,,283,10.3389/fphys.2017.00283,0,,,,,,,,28536536.0000,,,,,WOS:000403225300001,0.0

To date, the role(s) of KCCs in the renal functions of mosquitoes and other insects is less clear. In the present study, we sought molecular and functional evidence for the presence of a KCC in renal (Malpighian) tubules of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Using RT-PCR on Aedes Malpighian tubules, we identified five alternatively spliced partial cDNAs that encode putative SLC12-like KCCs. The majority transcript is AeKCC1-A(1); its full-length cDNA was cloned. After expression of the AeKCC1-A protein in Xenopus oocytes, the Cl--dependent uptake of Rb-86(+) is 1) activated by 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide and cell swelling, 2) blocked by 100 mu M dihydroindenyloxyalkanoic acid (DIOA), and 3) dependent upon N-glycosylation of AeKCC1-A. In Aedes Malpighian tubules, AeKCC1 immunoreactivity localizes to the apical brush border of principal cells, which are the predominant cell type in the epithelium. In vitro physiological assays of Malpighian tubules show that peritubular DIOA (10 mu M): 1) significantly reduces both the control and diuretic rates of transepithelial fluid secretion and 2) has negligible effects on the membrane voltage and input resistance of principal cells. Taken together, the above observations indicate the presence of a KCC in the apical membrane of principal cells where it participates in a major electroneutral transport pathway for the transepithelial secretion of fluid in this highly electrogenic epithelium.",,,,,"Piermarini, Peter/AAO-5666-2021","Piermarini, Peter/0000-0003-1020-5774",,,,,,,,,,,,,0363-6119,1522-1490,,,,NOV,2011,301.0,5,,,,,R1318,R1337,,10.1152/ajpregu.00223.2011,0,,,,,,,,21813871.0000,,,,,WOS:000296742100012,0.0

Pyrite is the dominant sulfide mineral in most samples presented within this study, and thus the trace element composition of pyrite may reflect the different metal sources and precipitation processes. Here, we report on a systematic study of minor and trace element contents in pyrite from active and inactive submarine hydrothermal vent fields at different plate-tectonic settings including the Indian and Mid-Atlantic Ridges, the Tonga-Kermadec intra-oceanic arc, the Lau back-arc and the central Okinawa Trough. Our results show that the trace element contents of pyrite from different locations vary significantly but for most elements without any systematic correlation to the concentration in the magmatic host rocks. Only As appears to be depleted in pyrite from ultramafic-hosted vent systems that are affected by serpentinization. These As depleted pyrites preferentially host Au-0 micro- or nano-particles. Bismuth is enriched in pyrite from hydrothermal systems that contain a sedimentary component and micro-inclusions of sphalerite are either due to fluid-sediment interaction or phase-separated fluid venting. Pyrites from individual locations have highly variable concentrations of elements like Au, Co, Cu, Se, Mo, Ag and Sb that are most likely related to fluid evolution and changes in fluid composition. Sub-seafloor hydrothermal fluid-seawater mixing influences the distribution of Au, Se and Mo in pyrite. Elements like Au, Ag, Sb and Pb often have a characteristic affinity to As, while Cd correlates closely with Zn. A magmatic volatile contribution to the Hine Hina hydrothermal system may result in the precipitation of Cu-enriched pyrite. Our results show that the concentrations of most trace metals in pyrite are a function of the physicochemical parameters of the fluid phase rather than a reflection of the magmatic host rock composition.

These index glaciers are used to estimate annual mass balance and volume water equivalent changes for the over 3000 glaciers on the Southern Alps. Two methods are employed to monitor ice volume changes. Method I deals with the rapid to normal response time glaciers, which tend to be small to medium in size. It uses mass balance gradients and glacier areas to convert changes in snowlines to changes in ice volume water equivalent. Ice volume changes for the period 1976-2008 are calculated for each index glacier, and then extrapolated to most other glaciers of the Southern Alps, using the New Zealand glacier inventory. Method II deals with 12 protracted response glaciers, which tend to be large in size. These have been slow in reacting to a long-term regional warming trend. Instead they still largely retain the ablation areas of a century ago and are in a state of disequilibrium with the present climate. These valley glaciers have recently sustained substantial ice losses that are not able to be detected using Method I. Mass balance deficits and ablation from the 12 large protracted response glaciers are estimated using a geodetic approach based on topographic and lake changes determined from repeated surveys. Results show that estimated ice volume (in water equivalents) for the Southern Alps has decreased from 54.5 km(3) in 1976 to 46.1 km(3) by 2008. This equates to a rate of -0.3 km(3)a(-1) over the last three decades, but this is considerably less than the rate of ice volume loss estimated for the previous 100 years. More than 3000 small and medium-size glaciers account for just 29% of the overall ice volume loss from the Southern Alps, while 71% of the loss occurs from the 12 large protracted response glaciers. Terminus calving contributes 0.8 km(3) and down-wasting of ice tongues in the ablation zone contributes 5.2 km(3). Some preliminary results show that ice volume changes are related to changes in circulation over the New Zealand region. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The study was conducted to assess the impact of early detection of SMA by newborn screening (NBS) on the clinical course of the disease. Methods: Screening was performed in two federal states of Germany, Bavaria and North Rhine Westphalia, between January 2018 and February 2019. The incidence in the screening population was calculated as number of detected patients with a homozygous deletion in the SMN1-gene per number of screened patients. To get an idea about the incidence of newly diagnosed SMA in the year prior to screening a survey covering all neuropediatric centers in the state of Bavaria was conducted, identifying all SMA-cases in 2017 and 2018. Following positive NBS and confirmatory diagnostic test, treatment was advised according to the recommendations of the American SMA NBS Multidisciplinary Working Group Immediate treatment with Nusinersen was recommended in children with 2 and 3 SMN2 copies and a conservative strict follow-up strategy in children with >= 4 copies. All children underwent regular standardized neuropediatric examination, CHOP INTEND and HINE-2 testing as well as electrophysiological exams every 2-3 months. Results: 165, 525 children were screened. 22 cases of SMA were identified, meaning an incidence rate of 1:7524. SMN2 copy number analysis showed 2 SMN2 copies in 45% of patients, 3 SMN2 copies in 19 % and 4 SMN2 copies in 36%. These findings are confirmed in the most recent statistical data-cut from 31st August 2019 (incidence 1:7089, 2 SMN2 copies in 44%, 3 in 15% and 4 in 38%). Comparison with up-to-date German data on SMA incidence and the Bavarian survey give evidence that NBS did not lead to a relevant increase in incidence. 10 patients with 2 or 3 SMN2 copies were treated with Nusinersen, starting between 15-39 days after birth, in 7/10 patients before onset of symptoms. Presymptomatically treated patients (age at last examination: 1-12 months, median 8 months) showed no muscle weakness by the age of one month to one year. One child with 4 SMN2 copies became symptomatic at the age of 8 months. Conclusions: Newborn screening, resulting in presymptomatic treatment, improves outcome in children with genetically proven SMA. Newborn screening for SMA should be introduced in all countries where therapy is available.

More importantly, the Florida open marine marsh system appears to be keeping pace with current rates of sea-level rise in spite of a limited inorganic sediment supply and low tidal energies. Although the magnitudes and directions of suspended solid transport and the processes controlling these transports have been rigorously documented for other U.S.A. marsh systems, they have not been documented in the Florida marsh system. Total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations, current speeds and water levels were monitored in Cedar Creek, Florida, so that the TSS loads could be calculated and the processes exerting control over material exchange could be determined. Both TSS concentration and load are modulated by spring/neap variations and time-velocity asymmetries in the tidal currents. Concentrations at the creek mouth increase by as much as two orders of magnitude during strong wind events due to the presence of waves; however, large net sediment loads appear to be related to the coupled effects of waves and large tidal prisms. Waves initially mobilize sediments in the adjacent embayment but increased tidal prisms, and the associated higher velocities, are requisite for transport of this material further into the creek. Large tidal prisms may be the result of astronomically high tides or meteorologically forced tides. In Cedar Creek, the most important meteorological events affecting sedimentary processes are extra-tropical storms. This is because they occur at much higher frequencies than tropical storms and hurricanes, even though the latter are more potent and potentially could transport greater amounts of material. This study identifies the important processes controlling suspended solid transport in the broad expanses of Juncus roemerianus dominated marsh adjacent to the large arcuate embayments prevalent along the west-central Florida marsh coast as described by Hine and Belknap (1988). The processes exerting control over sediment transport in the Cedar Creek drainage basin are similar to those documented in other marsh systems.

Three major hydrothermal fields (Hine Hina, Vai Lili, and White Church) were discovered in the areas of the greatest differention of volcanic rocks. The type of hydrothermal deposit is controlled by the type of volcanism and by tectonic activity which increases from south to north. Three stages of sulfide formation are proposed. During the first stage (Hina Hina field), diffuse discharge through volcaniclastic material produces extensive Fe-Mn oxide crusts covering sulfide deposits within the volcanic material. During the second stage (Vai Lili field), tectonic activity increases and fault-controlled discharge forms chimneys on the sea floor. Diffuse discharge is still present. During the third stage (White Church field), hydrothermal activity is completely controlled by major faults and results in the development of sulfide mounds. Vent fluids at Valu Fa have much higher metal contents than those at midocean ridges. Cl enrichment is best explained by mixing with deep brine rather than by subcritical phase separation and there is no evidence for a magmatic fluid contribution. Some characteristics of the fluids, such as low pH (2) and low concentration of H2S, can be explained by subsea-floor sulfide formation. The water-rock reaction zone is estimated to be about 1 km below the sea floor and 2 km above the magma chamber. Vertical mineralogical zonation within the mound differs from midocean ridge deposits but is similar to that of a kuroko deposit. At the surface of the deposit, the virtual absence of pyrite and the high amount of sphalerite, barite, tennantite, galena, and locally, native gold are remarkable. The distinctive chemical characteristics of deposits in each volcanic segment are explained by interaction with variable amounts of differentiated rocks. Compared to midocean ridges, Lau basin deposits are enriched in Ba, Zn, As, Pb, Ag, Au, and Hg and depleted in Mo, Se, and Co. Relative to young intracontinental back-are basins (e.g., Okinawa trough), the mineralizations are Pb and As poor. Their mineralogy, chemical composition, and geologic setting show that the southern Lau basin deposits are intermediate between oceanic and continental back-are deposits.",,,,,"Fouquet, yves/HLH-2791-2023",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0361-0128,,,,,DEC,1993,88.0,8,,,,,2154,2181,,10.2113/gsecongeo.88.8.2154,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993MZ45100009,0.0

(1994a). Modelling contrast sensitivity as a function of retinal illuminance and grating area. Vision Research, 34, 1301-1314) to colour vision by taking into account the fact that due to the spatio-chromatic opponency of retinal ganglion cells and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) neurons, equiluminous chromatic gratings are not affected by precortical lateral inhibition. We then tested the extended model by using Mullen's experimental data (Mullen, K. J. (1985). The contrast sensitivity of human color vision to red-green and blue-yellow chromatic gratings. Journal of Physiology, 359, 381-400). The band-pass shape of the spatial contrast sensitivity function for luminance-modulated green and yellow gratings transformed to a low-pass shape, resembling the chromatic spatial contrast sensitivity function for red-green and blue-yellow equiluminous gratings, when the effect of precortical lateral inhibition on grating contrast was computationally removed by dividing luminance contrast sensitivities by spatial frequency (i.e. by af, where a = 1 degrees). After the removal of this direct effect of lateral inhibition, there still remained a residual shape difference between the spatial contrast sensitivity functions for chromatic and luminance gratings. It was due to indirect reduction of grating visibility by quantal noise high-pass filtered by precortical lateral inhibition. When this indirect effect of quantal noise was also removed, contrast sensitivity for luminance gratings was about twice the sensitivity for chromatic gratings at all spatial frequencies. This was evidently due to the fact that the chromatic contrast of the equiluminous grating at the opponent stage (Cole, G. R., Hine, T. & McIihagga, W. (1993). Detection mechanisms in L-, M-, and S-cone contrast space. Journal of the Optical Society of America A, 10, 38-51) was about half of the luminance contrast of either of its chromatic component. Thus, if the contrast of the equiluminous chromatic grating were not expressed as the Michelson contrast of one chromatic component grating against its own background (Mullen, 381-400) but as chromatic contrast at the opponent stage, contrast sensitivity would be the same for chromatic and luminance gratings.

Design Repeated cross sectional study with data from individual patients, 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2006. Setting Hospital episode statistics (HES) dataset. Participants 564 821 patients aged 50 and over admitted with a diagnosis of colorectal, or lung cancer. Main outcome measures Proportion of patients admitted as emergencies, and the proportion receiving the recommended surgical treatment. Results Patients from deprived areas, older people, and women were more likely to be admitted as emergencies. For example, the adjusted odds ratio for patients with breast cancer in the least compared with most deprived fifth of deprivation was 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.66) and the adjusted odds ratio for patients with lung cancer aged 80-89 compared with those aged 50-59 was 3.13 (2.93 to 3.34). There were some improvements in disparities between age groups but not for patients living in deprived areas over time. Patients from deprived areas were less likely to receive preferred procedures for rectal, and lung cancer. These findings did not improve with time. For example, 67.4% (3529/5237) of patients in the most deprived fifth of deprivation had anterior resection for rectal cancer compared with 75.5% (4497/5959) of patients in the least deprived fifth (1.34, 1.22 to 1.47). Over half (54.0%, 11256/20849) of patients in the most deprived fifth of deprivation had breast conserving surgery compared with 63.7% (18445/28960) of patients in the least deprived fifth (1.21, 1.16 to 1.26). Men were less likely than women to undergo anterior resection and lung cancer resection and older people were less likely to receive breast conserving surgery and lung cancer resection. For example, the adjusted odds ratio for lung cancer patients aged 80-89 compared with those aged 50-59 was 0.52 (0.46 to 0.59). Conclusions Despite the implementation of the NHS Cancer Plan, social factors still strongly influence access to and the provision of care.",,,,,,"Raine, Rosalind/0000-0003-0904-749X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1756-1833,,,,,JAN 14,2010,340.0,,,,,,,,b5479,10.1136/bmj.b5479,0,,,,,,,,20075152.0000,,,,,WOS:000273711700004,0.0

Therefore, shortening the delay in providing survival estimates is desirable. Period analysis can estimate cancer survival by the use of recent data. We aimed to apply the period-analysis method to data that were collected by European cancer registries to estimate recent survival by country and cancer site, and to assess survival changes in Europe. We also compared our findings with data on cancer survival in the USA from the US SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) programme. Methods We analysed survival data for patients diagnosed with cancer in 2000-02, collected from 47 of the European cancer registries participating in the EUROCARE-4 study. 5-year period relative survival for patients diagnosed in 2000-02 was estimated as the product of interval-specific relative survival values of cohorts with different lengths of follow-up. 5-year survival profiles for patients diagnosed in 2000-02 were estimated for the European mean and for five European regions, and findings were compared with US SEER registry data for patients diagnosed in 2000-02. A 5-year survival profile for patients diagnosed in 1991-2002 and a 10-year survival profile for patients diagnosed in 1997-2002 were also estimated by the period method for all malignancies, by geographical area, and by cancer site. Findings For all cancers, age-adjusted 5-year period survival improved for patients diagnosed in 2000-02, especially for patients with colorectal, breast, prostate, and thyroid cancer, Hodgkin's s disease, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The European mean age-adjusted 5-year survival calculated by the period method for 2000-02 was high for testicular cancer (97.3% [95% CI 96.4-98.2]), melanoma (86.1% [84.3-88 .0]), thyroid cancer (83.2% [80.9-85 . 6]), Hodgkin' s disease (81.4% [78.9-84. 1]), female breast cancer (79.0% [78.1-80 . 0]), corpus uteri (78.0% [76.2-79.9]), and prostate cancer (77.5% [76.5-78.6]); and low for stomach cancer (24.9% [23.7-26.2]), chronic myeloid leukaemia (32.2% [29.0-3 5.7]), acute myeloid leukaemia. (14.8% [13.4-16.4]), and lung cancer (10 - 9% [10.5-11.4]). Survival for patients diagnosed in 2000-02 was generally highest for those in northem European countries and lowest for those in eastem European countries, although, patients in eastern European had the highest improvement in survival for major cancer sites during 1991-2002 (colorectal cancer from 30.3% [28.3-32 .5] to 44.7% [42.8-46 .7]; breast cancer from 60% [57.2-63.0] to 73.9% [71.7-76.2]; for prostate cancer from 39.5% [35.0-44.6] to 68.0% [64 - 2-72.1]). For all solid tumours, with the exception of stomach, testicular, and soft-tissue cancers, survival for patients diagnosed in 2000-02 was higher in the US SEER registries than for the European mean. For haematological malignancies, data from US SEER registries and the European mean were comparable in 2000-02, except for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Interpretation Cancer-service infrastructure, prevention and screening programmes, access to diagnostic and treatment facilities, tumour-site-specific protocols, multidisciplinary management, application of evidence-based clinical guidelines, and recruitment to clinical trials probably account for most of the differences that we noted in outcomes.",,,,,"Brenner, Hermann/ABE-6383-2020; Mangone, Lucia/J-4701-2016; Brenner, Hermann/B-4627-2017; Gatta, Gemma/B-8627-2017; Francisci, Silvia/J-4875-2018","Brenner, Hermann/0000-0002-6129-1572; Mangone, Lucia/0000-0002-5089-5178; Brenner, Hermann/0000-0002-6129-1572; Gatta, Gemma/0000-0003-4160-6458; Micheli, Andrea/0000-0002-4558-4754; Francisci, Silvia/0000-0002-1552-1744",,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-2045,1474-5488,,,,SEP,2007,8.0,9,,,,,784,796,,10.1016/S1470-2045(07)70246-2,0,,,,,,,,17714993.0000,,,,,WOS:000249862800025,0.0
